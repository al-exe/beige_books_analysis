       "'Most respondents have scaled down their third and fourth quarter forecasts of real GNP, but the core inflation rate is expected to remain around 9%. A bank economist, who previously forecasted strong growth in real GNP for the second half of 1981, now expects only 1% growth in the third quarter and 2.5% in the fourth quarter. A steel economist and a retail trade economist see prospects for a negative third quarter and possibly fourth quarter, if interest rates do not fall. However, several respondents expect that tax cut incentives and declining interest rates will provide stimulus by September to support a positive third quarter. The fall in interest rates assumes that business loan demand weakens and monetary policy eases.Inflation continues to be a major concern of respondents, with a widespread view that further moderation involves bringing down wage and employment cost increases. Also, several respondents are concerned that the effects of tight monetary policy on output will limit productivity gains that are necessary to reduce the core rate of inflation.'"
