50,51,6-17-1970,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,remarks by leading bankers and businessmen in the second district suggest a significant further slowdown in economic activity as well as increased financial pressures the labor market is showing signs of greater ease consumers are downgrading their purchases and retail profits are being squeezed very hard capital spending plans are being further reduced and a growing number of firms may be unable to repay their credits at maturity although expectations of a real recession have increased inflation continues to be viewed as a major problemas for the labor market most respondents indicated it was still difficult to get quality labor even though there are many more applicants than formerly one however declared the market had recently undergone a sharp change with quality people now available and another observed that the rate of turnover amongst his firms management trainees had declinedconsumer spending is generally weak and profits in the retail industry have suffered considerably from narrowed margins conditions were described as very bad by the head of a nationwide chain of department and discount stores and a top official in one of the countrys largest department stores characterized late may and early june as very very soft notably weak sectors included home furnishings television sets large appliances and men s wear among reasons given for consumers holding back were fear of unemployment effects of higher prices high interest rates the rather poor business situation and general uncertaintyconsumers in general were said to be downgrading or to be paying more attention to value to utility to price discount stores were reportedly doing better than regular department stores a very definite tendency toward downgrading was noted in the purchase of clothing there has also been a definite downgrading in auto buying with a shift toward cheaper models and strippeddown versions without radios air conditioning or heaters moreover people are turning increasingly to used cars another sector affected by either downgrading or value considerations has been education increased tuition as well as other costs has resulted in lower enrollments in private educational institutions with more students choosing statesupported schools only a few comments were at odds with the downgrading picture food dealers reportedly see an opposite trend and a recently developed camera priced to sell for less than 10 is eating up company storage spacecapital spending plans for 1970 are reportedly being reduced further by many firms some are reviewing their plans for the second or third time this year others are resorted to have already trimmed plans significantly apparently projects that are being stretched out or delayed are most often those designed to provide additional capacity however firms in the food industry do not seem to be altering their plans nor are cutbacks being made in plans designed to save labor or to reduce pollutionmany business firms are suffering a liquidity squeeze among contributing factors are reduced profits and a relatively rapid rise in accounts receivable the transportation industry has real liquidity problems and petroleum companies are finding liquidity more of a problem the head of a large bank said he was hesitant to discuss the quite serious corporate liquidity problem because of the possible pyramiding effect but declared that many companies may not be able to meet their maturities and that some substantial corporations will be unable to meet their payrolls without refinancingthe liquidity squeeze is having repercussions on the commercial paper market this market is giving one new york city banker nightmares some companies that use the market in very large volume are having difficulty rolling over their paper some commercial paper dealers have told some corporations they cannot continue to handle their issues it was estimated that 60 percent of all commercial paper issued today has backup bank credit lines if the commercial paper market were to collapse the major money market banks would not be able to meet the demand for credit moreover many of the smaller banks around the country are holding large amounts of commercial paperthe number of bankers and businessmen who expect a further slowdown in the economy has increased markedly upstate new york bankers made special note of the considerable decline that has occurred in new orders received by many manufacturers some however still think it most likely there will be a resumption of real growth in the second halfregardless of expectations as to real growth there is continued concern about wagecost pressures and the dangers of inflation two comments seemed to suggest a belief that inflation can be ended only by a recession the public will believe price stability is assured only if we havea serious recession or depression and the risk of a recession is preferable to continued inflation many bankers and businessmen see some sort of incomes policy as desirable one banker expressed opposition to any sort of incomes policy declaring it was not needed and could even do harm by producing an anticipatory rise in prices and wages
62,63,7-15-1970,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,in the second federal reserve district directors of the federal reserve bank and other business executives saw some signs that prices were easing indicated they believed the recent stretchout of capital spending plans would continue into 1971 and expressed the opinion that in general inventories were higher than business firms desired while it was thought the current strains in the financial markets did not pose a serious immediate threat to business activity considerable concern was expressed regarding business liquidityonly two of the federal reserve bank directors who attended the early july meetings at new york and buffalo were aware of any price shading by manufacturers but more directors mentioned other signs of an improvement in the overall price situation these included announced price cuts particularly at the retail level as well as price shading at the retail level by giving the customer greater value with regard tounderthecounter price adjustments it was reported that bethlehem steel corporation had taken a strong position against such a marketing practice as for announced cuts by manufacturers one director noted receiving an announcement of a three percent reduction in the price of cans for packaging beverages at the retail level there has been considerable price cutting by automobile dealers as well as by other retail outlets with the aim of either reducing inventories or building sales volumeretail store sales reportedly were holding up well except at downtown stores and during night shopping hours sales apparently were being bolstered by aggressive merchandising the head of a large chain observed however that retail stores need an increase of three to three and one half percent in volume to bring profit up to last years level contributing to this need were higher costs stemming from increases in wage rates in shipping charges and in shopliftingthe directors were virtually unanimous in believing that the more cautious capital spending pattern that apparently has developed in recent months will continue into 1971 new programs were being very carefully reviewed and many projects were being slowed down or indefinitely deferred however projects for which commitments are too far along to be canceled or postponed are being completed as probably will be projects designed to cut production costs and increase productivity although an upstate new york banker remarked that there were no signs of cutback in his area he observed that most of the capital spending there was on construction for municipalities and school districts for which firm contracts had been arranged long ago on the other hand a community college construction project for which bids were recently obtained may have to be canceled because the bids are so far above the original estimatesthe few comments made on the inventory situation suggested that inventories were higher than were desired a new york banker commented that inventories in general are eight to ten percent above a year ago and that increased inventories were particularly evident in the soft goods area the chairman of a large manufacturing firm observed that inventories were high mainly because business is not selling goods as fast as desired although special factors such as the recent truckers strike in chicago had contributed to the buildup as had a new permanent inflation factor that has been built into inventoriesmost directors seemed to believe the current strains in the financial markets did not pose a serious threat to business activity at the present time although the head of a large new york city bank declared he thought there would be adverse effects but was unable to judge whether these would be serious despite the nearconsensus that there was no immediate threat a number of directors and other business executives did indicate concern regarding financial developments a banker from upstate new york noted that many businessmen who have longterm financings in the offing are attempting to arrange standby intermediate or shortterm credits as possible alternative solutions to their financing needs an investment banker commented that his firm had been marketing fourtofive year securities for many clients and that if inflation is not halted he sees an end to public financing of debt issues a large retailer observed that small manufacturers were in serious shape with regard to liquidity they cannot borrow as easily as very big concerns and at the same time big retailers are slower in making payments to them than in the past inasmuch as the discount for prompt payment is less than the cost of borrowing money customer payments to retail stores were also noted as slower than usual the head of a new york academic institution declared the long decline in the stock market had cut gifts to private educational institutions and had drastically reduced the market value of holdings of endowed institutions finally a wall street man guessed that only 300 of todays 500 new york stock exchange member firms would survive the next six months but regarded mergers which he believes will accelerate as desirablean upstate new york banker commented there is still considerable demand for credit in the rochester area particularly for real estate projects but the head of a giant insurance company observed that the demand for new money was somewhat depressed and that requests for policy loans had leveled this insurance company it was noted is moving in the direction of real estate investments and equity participations the chairman of a large mutual savings bank remarked late in june that although official figures indicate a recent pickup in deposits at thrift institutions there is no evidence of such a movement in new york city he thought that most of the deposit money that was being withdrawn was probably going into bonds he also indicated he was not sure his bank benefited from the use of merchandise premiums and said he would favor their being banned by the supervisory authorities

163,164,3-9-1971,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the overall impression of the economic outlook that emerged from opinions expressed by directors of the federal reserve bank of new york and of the buffalo branch and by other business leaders continued to be one of uncertainty with little indication that a strong recovery is in the offing sentiments were mixed regarding consumer spending it was generally agreed that no significant pickup in plant and equipment outlays was likely over the coming months a strike in the steel industry was widely expected and evidence of stockpiling was mounting business loan demand was reported to be holding up well in western new york buffalo but to be relatively weak in the new york city area as in previous months concern over inflation was evident with several respondents calling for more direct government action in this areawith respect to retail sales the treasurer of a large chain of department stores reported that business over the christmas season and during the january sales had been reasonably good but that sales in february had been sluggish and that his firm was budgeting for only a gradual increase over the coming months the vice president of a large photographic equipment firm stated that his company saw evidence of a lack of strength in consumer spending in the fact that retailers seemed to be living off their inventories the chairman of the board of a large new york city bank stated that consumer spending has not blossomed as might have been expected while the president of a large finance company felt that on the basis of consumer loans extended by his firm the consumer is still hanging on to his dollarson the other hand the executive vice president of a large new york city department store with branches in the suburbs reported that business had been excellent from the week before christmas through the third week of february 10 to 15 percent above last year although it subsequently slowed he looked for good solid business in the months ahead but expected that hard work in the form of promotional sales and good values would be required similarly the president of a rochester department store reported that salesnotably promotional saleswere better than last year finally several other respondents felt that retail business was good and the president of a chain of variety stores was very optimistic with respect to 1971 saleswith respect to outlays for plant and equipment respondents expressing an opinion on the subject generally saw no strengthening in such outlays as compared to a month ago ie 1971 outlays would probably remain at about 1970 levels in this context the respondents did not feel that liberalization of depreciation allowances would result in a significant upgrading of capital spending plansseveral bankers and other business leaders looked for an increase in inventory investment in the form of strikehedging stockpiling of steel a strike in the steel industry appeared to be widely expected although opinions differed as to its probable lengthone director felt it would be shortlived with the settlement in the automobile industry setting the pattern for the steel settlements others felt it would be longer with this expectation showing up in inventory policies thus two directors of the buffalo branch who are associated with firms using large quantities of steel reported their firms planned to have a 90day supply on hand by august 1 as against normal inventories for about 30 days while the large photographic concern looked for a long strike and plans to build its steel inventories to six to eight weeks above normal levels in addition several bankers reported making arrangements to finance a substantial buildup in steel inventories another director the president of a large manufacturing concern felt there would be a long strike if the economy is strong but none if it goes downviews regarding the demand for business loans at commercial banks varied according to locality the buffalo branch banker directors reported that loan demand at their banks was holding up well the chairman of a large new york city bank on the other hand saw the loan picture as weaker than a year ago the chairman of another smaller new york city bank characterized loan demand as sluggish and reported that his bank had not experienced any increase in demand following the prime rate cutsas in previous months deep concern was expressed over inflation a director characterized the recent government action in the construction industry as a step in the right direction several other business leaders however felt the need for stronger direct government action on the wage and price front one business leader felt that with the 1972 election ahead the president was caught between fire and drowning and would probably make concessions in the fight against inflation to reduce unemployment
175,176,4-6-1971,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the opinions expressed by the directors of this bank and the buffalo branch and other business leaders in general continued to point to an uncertain economic outlook on balance the assessment was a still cautious consumer attitude a somewhat less optimistic residential construction picture little or no improvement in the unemployment situation and relatively uninspiring prospects for 1971 corporate profits sentiments were mixed with respect to the likely volume of further corporate borrowing in the bond marketin view of most of the directors and of the retailers that were contacted the long awaited rebound in consumer spending has not as yet materialized indeed it was generally believed that no real pickup in consumer spending could be expected as long as consumer confidence continued to be adversely affected by the unemployment situation several of the respondents however felt that given the current high rates of individual savings a change in consumer mood could well trigger a sharp increase in such outlayswith respect to residential housing construction the picture painted by the respondents was somewhat less rosy than it had been in earlier months to be sure the consensus was that there still remained a shortage of housing for lower and middle income families and that mortgage money had become more readily available at lower rateson the other hand it was felt that to a large extent the demand for housing was being met by multiple housing units rather than by single family units with several of the directors expressing the opinion that the high cost of construction and the increase in property taxes acted as stronger deterrents to single home purchases than the current level of mortgage ratessimilarly the directors in general were less than sanguine regarding the employment situation two of the directors felt the employment picture had strengthened somewhat in the buffalo area as a result of the resumption of activity at plants providing parts for the automobile industry and increased employment in the steel industry due to strike hedging inventory accumulation however the chairman of the board of a large new york city bank reported that layoffs were continuing in the airlines railroad and other industries while the vice president of the largest firm in rochester saw no sign of strengthening of the employment picture in his industry moreover the president of a large department store in that city reported that more workers were being laid off without publicity and that unemployment was rising most of the other respondents expressing an opinion on the subject either saw no improvement or a further weakening in the unemployment picturesentiments regarding the outlook for corporate profits in 1971 also were not particularly optimistic the buffalo branch directors all felt that 1971 profits would be at or above 1970 levels but well below those of 1969 the chairman of the large new york city bank regarded the outlook for corporate profits in 1971 as not too bright another director expected 1971 profits to be flat while some directors felt that profits would be lower than in 1970opinions were mixed regarding the prospects for a letup in the volume of corporate borrowing in the bond market in the near future the directors of the buffalo branch unanimously felt that corporations would continue to tap that marketas well as the commercial paper marketto meet their credit needs with the paying off of commercial loans continuing at a substantial rate a director of the new york bank on the other hand noted that while sec registrations for corporation bond market borrowings were still heavy in volume they were lower than a few months ago and he believed such borrowings would level out similarly the chairman of the large new york city bank felt that corporate bond market borrowing would not continue at its current pace for very long
187,188,5-5-1971,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,a distinctly rosier picture of consumer spending than that painted a month ago emerged from the views expressed by the directors of this bank and of the buffalo branch and other business leaders with some exceptions however business confidence outside of the retail area was less than strong nevertheless the implementation at this time of fiscal measures to stimulate the economy were generally opposed reflecting concern over the continued presence of inflation pressures the presidents program to curb the rise in cost in the construction industry was given little or no chance of successwith respect to consumer spending the chairman of the board of a large retail chain that includes a number of sizable department stores and a large diversified apparel manufacturing business was very optimistic he reported a sharp increase in his firms sales in recent weeks both through its own outlets as well as to other major retailers and felt that the consumer had finally turned loose the vice president of another large retail chain reported that his firms business had picked up somewhat in the past month and that he looked for a good increase in the months ahead similar sentiments were expressed by the president of a relatively high priced new york city department store with branches in the suburbs while the president of a large medium priced store felt there had been a definite improvement in recent weeks and assessed retail sales prospects with restrained optimism several presidents of upstate banks saw an upsurge in consumer confidence while the president of a textile firm stated that his retail store customers were building up inventories of his firms products indeed with varying degrees of enthusiasm all the directors and other business leaders that expressed an opinion on the subject felt either that sales had picked up in the past weeks or shortly would do soviews expressed regarding business confidence were somewhat more guarded the chairman and president of a diversified electronic concern did not look for a roaring upswing in business in the immediate future the president of an upstate bank saw businessmen as hopeful but waiting to see more sign of an upturn some of the respondents however expressed the opinion that the rise in consumer spending and the concomitant increase in reorders should soon be reflected in a strengthening of general business confidencethe president of one of the largest construction companies in the country stated that he was very optimistic over the immediate future he did express concern however over the labor costs in the construction industry he looked for continued high wage increases with little or no improvement in productivity he felt that the presidents voluntary program for wage and price restraint had no real teeth and probably would have little effect indeed the respondents that expressed an opinion on this subject showed an almost total lack of confidence in the effectiveness of this program this attitude was perhaps best summed up in the remarks of the vice president of rochesters largest firm a director who stated that he saw no chance for success in the program and who indicated that his contacts with the organized construction industry show no influence from the programcontinued concern over the danger of refueling inflationary pressures was also reflected in the fact that even though business confidence still seemed to be lacking real strength all but one of the respondents who commented on the topic felt that it would be unwise at this time to attempt to speed economic recovery through additional fiscal stimulus through the tax cut speedups that have recently been proposed most agreed however that if fiscal stimulus is desired the implementation of these proposals would be the best way to proceedwith respect to bank lending policies most bankers reported that their banks were seeking to make new loans in some cases aggressively the chairman of the board of an upstate bank however noted that the easing of credit terms seen in commercial centers had not spread to country areas and that his bank was not aggressively seeking new business loans
199,200,6-2-1971,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the overall picture that emerges from the answers to the questions raised with the directors of this bank and of the buffalo branch and with other business leaders is one of cautious optimism regarding the economic outlook consumer spending was generally reported to be risingalbeit moderatelywhile there were no indications of further cutbacks in capital outlays a good number of the respondents pointed to weak spotsnotably the adverse effect of high costs on residential construction and a continued unsatisfactory unemployment situationwith respect to consumer spending most of the directors indicated that such spending has continued on the upswing during the past month although the majority felt the rise was only moderate for example the chairman of the board of a rochester department store characterized the upward trend in retail sales as slight while it was the consensus of the buffalo branch directors that although they noted a slight acceleration in consumer spending was occurring there was no clear signal of a dramatic change in consumer attitudesmost of the respondents expressing an opinion on residential construction looked for a continued increase in activity in this sector virtually all of these respondents felt that home building activity was inhibited by the high price of houses rather than by relatively high mortgage rates or a lack of mortgage funds a typical reaction to this question was that of the chairman of the board of a large manufacturing concern who stated that he believed that inflated prices were the limiting factor in the home building area similar sentiments were expressed by all the directors of the buffalo branchturning to expenditures for plant and equipment the continued lack of strength in this area was attributed to unused capacity and the accompanying decline in the profitability of recent capital investment which have led corporations to be very conservative in their capital spending plans however there were no indications of further cutbacks in such expenditures the president of a large oil corporation felt that oil companies and utilities must continue to expand plants to meet demand and that as a matter of fact these industries are shifting to a scarcity theme because they cannot meet the nations energy needs the feeling was general that the relatively high interest rates in the corporate bond market has little or no effect in limiting capital spendingin general the unemployment situation was described as unsatisfactory the buffalo branch directors saw no improvement and indicated that local labor markets continued to be sluggish the chairman of the rochester department store stated that unemployment in that city was still rising the president of an ithaca bank however reported that unemployment in his area at about 5 percent was better than the average and had leveled off
212,213,7-21-1971,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the opinions expressed recently by second district federal reserve bank directors seemed to reflect some renewed doubts regarding the strength of the economic recovery the directors in general foresaw no nearterm improvement in the unemployment pictureindeed a few expected further weakeningand some felt that additional disruptive strikes were in the offing on the other hand the outlook for consumer spending and residential construction remains good no significant changes in the trends in these sectors were thought to have occurred in the recent past most of the directors felt that a widespread lack of confidence among both businessmen and consumers is a major factor in the disappointingly slow rate of economic recoveryconcerning the unemployment situation the directors felt the continuing efforts of businessmen to cut back costs made it unlikely that a significant reduction of unemployment would be achieved in the coming months the chairman of the board of a large new york city bank said he expected that his firm would have a smaller staff at the end of 1971 than it had earlier in the year and felt that other financial institutionsthe citys strongest employersalso would not contribute much support for the local job market this year the president of a nationwide manufacturer of plumbing and related products felt that the wagecost squeeze was forcing industry to cut back on spending and employment the buffalo branch directors agreed that labor markets in their locality generally continue to experience an oversupply of persons seeking a limited number of job openings and said the permanent closing of some plants has aggravated the situation several directors also referred to the fiscal difficulties of state and local governments as a factor inhibiting hiring by these bodies one exception noted by an upstate manufacturer was that employment in the automotive parts industry has been holding up wellthis rather dim unemployment picture to some extent conditioned the directors views with respect to potential labor strikes most directors agreed that further strikes could be expected since labor leaders felt obliged to attempt to gain at least the same benefits for their members that other unions have received in the recent past this view was most forcefully advanced by the chairman of the board of the large new york city bank and by the president of the plumbing concern upstate directors on the other hand tended to see a reduction in labor disputes some of the buffalo directors for example felt that there would be no steel strike because steel workers were becoming aware of both the worsening competitive position of u s steel in world markets and the fact that strikehedge inventorybuilding by steel users would minimize the potential harm of a strike to the steel companies moreover the other buffalo directors who did believe a strike was in the offing thought it would be a short one all of the buffalo directors felt that the settlement would be somewhat less generous than that obtained in recent other major industrial wage agreements although most felt that the settlement could not depart significantly from those recently negotiated in the aluminum and can industriesthere seemed to be little change in recent weeks in the directors assessments of the outlook for consumer spending and residential construction outlays for consumer goods were generally reported to be running at a level well ahead of last year but have not as yet reached boom proportions in regard to residential construction the directors generally felt that activity in this sector was running at a satisfactory level or would do so soon the chairman of the board of a large rochester department store noted that political problems sometimes interfere with low and middleincome housing the president of an upstate bank felt that homebuilding activity in his area was strong but would be stronger except for the resistance of local officials to large projects and the lack of adequate sewage highway and school facilitiesmost of the second district directors stressed the lack of confidence among both business and consumers as a major factor inhibiting the economic recovery this feeling was perhaps most forthrightly expressed by the vice president of rochesters largest firm who said businessmen and consumers had lost confidence in the governments ability to design and execute programs which would lead the economy back to health along with a reduction in the rate of inflation he attributed this feeling in part to a lack of credibility in the economic statistics and forecasts developed by the federal government another upstate director described the situation as a nationwide stagnation of enthusiasm
226,227,8-18-1971,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the pessimism regarding the economic outlook that had been expressed by the directors of the new york bank and of the buffalo branch last month was still evident and perhaps intensified this month before the administration announced its new measures in general the assessment was for no significant change in consumer attitudes while some directors believed there had been an actual scaling back of buying intentions business inventory spending was not expected to strengthen in the near future no noticeable improvement in labor market conditions was foreseen and most of the directors felt that a general economic upturn would gain momentum later than had been generally expectedconcerning consumer spending the buffalo branch directors viewed retail sales activity as relatively better than a year ago but with no discernible trend either up or down the new york branch directors were somewhat more pessimistic a director from rochester had had recent discussions with a cross section of new york city department store executives who reported a slowdown in consumer spending in recent weeks and were generally pessimistic regarding the immediate future the chairman of the board of a nationwide manufacturing concern believed that consumers were exhibiting caution and more selectivity regarding both price and quality and saw consumer reluctance showing up particularly in discretionary spending such as that for travel other directors also thought there had been a scaling back in consumer buying plansone director the president of an upstate new york bank commented on construction activities he referred to the recent experience which he felt was fairly typical of a general contractor in his area who builds schools factories and other nonresidential structures this contractor after many years of good business now had few orders a development that the contractor attributed to high construction costs particularly wageswith respect to business inventory spending several directors expressed the opinion that such outlays would continue to be sluggish largely because of more stringent inventory controls as part of costreduction programsno noticeable change in the unemployment picture was expected by the buffalo branch directors they believed that layoffs in the steel industry would offset employment increases in the auto industry and in seasonal constructionall the buffalo directors expressed concern about the expected further erosion of the steel industrys competitive position in both foreign and domestic markets as a result of the recent steel wage and price developmentsregarding this countrys foreign trade in general the rochester merchant who is on the new york board noted that sales of imported goods have been increasing steadily another director expressed the opinion that the continued deterioration in this countrys exports was due chiefly to high prices resulting from high labor costs while a third director found our recent adverse trade balance surprising since european countries were also experiencing a high rate of inflationto assess recent developments and expectations for the next two months in commercial bank savings and consumertype time deposits and in loan demands nine district banks were contacted august 1113 five in new york and four out of town the majority of the banks reported that the strong increase in their deposits in the first five or six months of this year had been replaced by a slow attrition and most of them expected the attrition to continue or the rate of advance to flatten out at a majority of the banks demand for commercial and industrial loans had been weak or lusterless recently and the banks expected only seasonal fluctuations over the coming monthsas regards the general business outlook all the directors both of the new york bank and the buffalo branch were relatively pessimistic concerning nearterm developments with some directors noting that they thought a strong upturn would take longer than they had previously anticipated several directors expressed before president nixons august 15 address a lack of confidence in the administrations economic program
238,239,9-15-1971,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,comments by the directors of the new york bank and the buffalo branch and conversations with some large retailers indicate that initial reaction to the presidents new economic program has been favorable and that there is cautious optimism regarding the future an improvement in consumer spending which had started to manifest itself even before august 15 was reported as the brightest current development but doubts were expressed about anynearterm stimulus from the proposed investment tax credit most directors thought there would be good compliance with the wageprice freeze during phase one but some anticipated there would be problems if the freeze were extendedconsumer spending reportedly has shown definite improvement compared with previous months one of the directors associated with a rochester department store sensed that consumers approved of the presidents program he noted that since august 15 the pickup in august retail sales had become more pronounced the chairman of the board of a large new york city bank and the president of an upstate bank also thought consumer confidence had improved but the latter director commented that it remained to be seen to what extent and when this improvement would be reflected in increased consumer outlays the two retailers who were contacted by telephone who have stores nationwide reported that business had been quite good throughout august and that the presidents announcement seemed to have had only little effect in increasing consumer demand further they observed that other department store officials with whom they had discussed the matter had had this same experience the retailers indicated they were quite optimistic about the forthcoming holiday seasonthe directors thought that although business confidence may have been strengthened somewhat by the presidents new program there was little likelihood that the investment tax credit would bring a significant spurt in capital outlays over the near term primarily because of the current low rates of utilization of existing plant and equipment directors in buffalo thought that for those businesses that had already made capital spending plans the reinstatement of the tax credit would be a windfall while for those who had been on the fence concerning a project passage of the proposed legislation might trigger a decision to move ahead one of the new york bank directors noted that much of the americanmade machinery and equipment affected by the tax credit uses foreignmade parts however the chairman of the board of a large new york city bank believed the tax credit would promote capital spending ultimately and another director thought the proposed credit would stimulate those investments that would save labor costs and cut operating expendituresmost directors thought there would be little if any erosion of compliance with the wageprice freeze over the ninetyday period buffalo branch directors observed that the short period involved and the fact that noncompliance would stand out made the current freeze selfenforcing several of these directors however looked for enforcement problems if the freeze were extended while the chairman of the board of a large new york city bank felt that a myriad of administrative problems would appear even during phase one another director the president of a nationwide manufacturing concern expects an erosion in compliance as time goes on and the president of an upstate bank said he believes some people are trying to find ways to secure exceptions to the freezemost respondents to a survey of six large new york city banks indicated that some unexpected growth in demand for business credit had developed at their institutions in recent weeks over and above the increases that clearly reflected postaugust 15 developments in the foreign exchange markets but the majority had no explanation for this apparent strength or declared their particular banks experience was related to something unique the few explanations that were offered focused primarily on inventory building prudent businessmen feel they should get in their stocks while the freeze is on distributors are expecting a very strong christmas perhaps there is some inventorying in anticipation of a longshoremens strike on the east and gulf coasts nonetheless probably a major part of the huge increase in loans to wholesalers which constituted the biggest rise was attributable to borrowings made immediately prior to the flotation of the yen by japanese trading concerns resident in the united states
250,251,10-13-1971,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the improved economic expectations voiced last month by the directors of this bank and of the buffalo branch and by other business leaders continue to be in evidence a better outlook was seen in the retail trade sector including automobiles the employment picture was mixed with some slight improvement in certain areas compliance with the freeze was reported to be very good despite some wage dissatisfaction and some price evasionthe great majority of the directors of this bank and of the buffalo branch felt that the 90day wageprice freeze had been very well received one director the chairman of the board of a large manufacturing concern did feel that a head of steam was building up on wage demands resulting from contractual obligations and costofliving increases that had been set aside during the freezetwo directors referred to the growing bitterness of teachers whose wage increases were denied just as the new school year began most respondents felt that the wageprice freeze had been very effective with nearly 100 percent compliance however a director of the buffalo branch mentioned that an apparel retailer had told him that some manufacturers are violating the spirit if not the letter of the freeze by making minor style or lot number changes accompanied by increases in pricesthe majority of the directors and retailers believed that consumer spending was on the rise most respondents felt that consumer confidence had improved as a result of the new economic program although this reportedly was not much in evidence in upstate new york owing to unemployment prison riots and other depressing newsa number of the directors particularly those of the buffalo branch attributed at least part of the improvement in retail sales to a temporary bunching of purchases owing to anticipation of price increases at the end of the freeze one director the president of a rochester bank indicated that retail sales in the city had been adversely affected by bad weather and an official of a new york city quality department store felt that unseasonably warm weather had slowed down apparel sales even though his stores sales had improved three large new york city auto dealers who were contacted reported that the strength in auto sales that had emerged in september had continued into october significant gains in auto sales were also reported to have taken place in the buffalo areanotwithstanding the improved retail sales picture most respondents believed that retailers and jobbers were continuing to maintain a cautious inventory policy some exceptions were noted accounted for by special circumstances such as the dock strikes and the seasonal buildup of auto dealers inventories in general the trend toward relying on manufacturers to maintain stocks apparently was being maintainedmost directors did not feel that the present employment situation was overly bright but some improvement was reported to have taken place in the rochester and buffalo areas and payroll rosters in western new york are expected to expand with an increase in the economic pace on the other hand the president of a wellknown research organization reported that the unemployment picture in the nonprofit and teaching fields was bad and was likely to get worse
264,265,11-10-1971,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,on the basis of opinions expressed by the directors of the new york bank and of the buffalo branch the mood of rising optimism regarding the economy that appeared to be emerging last month has now been replaced by a significantly more subdued outlook much of the current assessment of the business situation is heavily conditioned by the uncertainties surrounding phase ii and to a certain extent by developments in the foreign exchange markets most felt that business activity would pick up in 1972 but on balance the sentiments expressed in this connection were cautious and most looked for only a moderate increaseregarding consumer spending the retailers that were contacted reported that business was better than last year but not very much so they looked for a good christmas season but were only conservatively optimistic regarding sales over the coming monthsvirtually all the directors of the new york bank and of the buffalo branch moreover saw no significant change in business capital spending plans among the new york bank directors the chairman of the board of a large manufacturing concern felt that at most there might have been some minor upward revisionsanother director a rochester businessman basing his comment on conversations with major manufacturers in the rochester area noted that the plans made in 1970 for 1972 had not been greatly changed similar sentiments were expressed by other directors the chairman of the board of a large new york city bank felt that the 9 percent increase in plant and equipment spending in 1972 indicated in the edie survey was optimistic while most of the buffalo directors felt that the 1972 increase would be closer to 6 or 7 percent than 9 percent the buffalo directors pointed to the uncertainties surrounding wage and price controls and the high rate of unutilized capacity as deterrents to capital spending these directors felt however that the capital goods spending picture could be improved by congressional action on an investment tax credit andor liberalized depreciation allowances which would clear away some of the present uncertaintiesin general most directors felt that apart from some instances of stock piling their own businesses had not been appreciably affected by developments in the foreign exchange markets the 10 percent surcharge and the dock strikesseveral of the buffalo directors noted that domestic automobile sales had been unusually brisk a development they attributed at least in part to the import surcharge the chairman of the board of a large new york city bank however was more pessimistic he reported growing evidence including a decline in foreign collections and in new import credits at his bank that developments affecting foreign exchange and trade are having a detrimental effect on business and cited reports that some contracts have been held up pending the clarification of the international financial situationmuch uncertainty was expressed about the effectiveness of phase ii opinions expressed predate the pay boards 55 percent decision in general the directors had a wait and see attitude the president of an upstate bank characterized the situation as confusion compounded by concern the buffalo branch directors expressed considerable uneasiness regarding labor union leaderships apparent tough stand against effective wage controls and its potential impact on any future wage control programagainst this background while most directors looked for some increase in economic activity sentiments as to the extent of the recovery were mixed among the bullish minority the vice president of rochesters largest firm predicted a growth in gnp of 9 to 9 12 percent in current dollars over the next six months citing the end of the inventory adjustment process and normal cyclical forces as the reasons for his optimism the former chairman of the board of a large oil corporation also thought there would be a significant business upturn if the international financial situation is straightened out the majority of the directors however were more cautious and in general linked their opinion regarding the potential advance to the extent of the success of phase ii
278,279,12-8-1971,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,assessment of the economic situation by the directors of the new york bank and the buffalo branch and by other business leaders continues restrained the feelings of uncertainty expressed last month concerning the effectiveness of phase ii in controlling inflation have not been dissipated little headway has been made in reducing unemployment business continues to pursue cautious inventory policies and the demand for business loans does not suggest any quickening in the pace of business activity consumer spending over the holiday season is generally expected to exceed last years levels although there was no feeling that the trend in such outlays was pointing toward boom proportionswith respect to phase ii the buffalo branch directors thought that the program might result in some slowing down in the rate of inflation but most were not optimistic regarding the chances of meeting the 2 12 per cent goal for prices these directors felt that the price commission would be reasonably successful in holding the price line particularly among larger companies but that the pay board would have difficulties in controlling wage increasesin part because the board in its initial operation was bucking against wage increases granted before the freeze period and not yet put into effect against this background of relatively more effective controls on prices than on wages the vice president of rochesters biggest firm predicted a profit squeeze particularly for large companies among the new york bank directors one characterized phase ii as a mixed up affair and suggested that the only way price increases could be held at 2 12 per cent would be if business is bad the chairman of the board of a large manufacturing concern felt that the program had a 5050 per cent chance of crudely and clumsily moderating the pace of inflation the same odds on the success of the program were also quoted by two buffalo branch directors he felt the program could not work for more than 12 to 18 months but regarded this as better than nothingas to the unemployment picture the directors that expressed an opinion on the subject generally saw little if any improvement the improvement in some scattered areas was attributed to special circumstances a rochester businessman a director of the new york bank not only saw no strengthening of the job situation but referred to further layoffs by his own firm and by life magazine the chairman of the board of the large manufacturing concern reported that he was not aware of any significant turn for the better among the buffalo branch directors only two saw some discernible improvement the vice president of rochesters largest firm saw a slight strengthening which he linked to the completion by most employers of their efforts to reduce costs and improve productivity the chairman of the board of a buffalo bank reported some increase in employment in the buffalo area associated with the partial resumption of steel production however he did not view this as indicating an overall upward trend in local employment and characterized the local labor market as still very weakin general the directors saw no indication of a significant pickup in business inventory spending the rochester businessman detected continued caution in businesses inventory policies none of the buffalo branch directors saw any change in such policies with the possible exception of retailers stocking up for the holiday season the chairman of the board of the large manufacturing concern however felt that there had been a slight improvement in this sector none of the directors reported a rise in business loan demand that might suggest a quickening of pace in business activity although the banker directors at the buffalo branch reported a strong demand for mortgage loanswith respect to consumer spending opinions were mixed and on balance not particularly exuberant most of the buffalo branch directors described retail sales as brisk and running above last year at least in dollar terms among the new york directors the president of an upstate bank pointed to the strong performance of automobile sales but felt that apart from this sector business remains spotty most of the retailers who were contacted reported that business had begun to pick up in recent days and they were expecting a good if not spectacular holiday season the chairman of the board of a large rochester department store however stated that his firm would be fortunate to equal last years dollar volume during this christmas season
291,292,2-9-1972,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,mixed opinions were expressed recently by the directors of this bank and of the buffalo branch as well as other local businessmen regarding the current economic situation most were disturbed by the implications of the presidents budget message but on balance felt that so far phase ii was having a beneficial effect on the economy only scattered improvement was reported in the unemployment picture in general it was felt that the prospects for increased business outlays on plant and equipment had not materially improved over the recent past however the majority looked for increased inventory outlays reflecting in good part a strengthening of consumer confidence as reported by the retailers that were contacted most directors that expressed an opinion felt that the international currency realignment had not had but eventually would have a beneficial impact on the countrys trade balanceconcern in varying degrees was expressed over the presidents recent budget message all of the buffalo branch directors saw the deficit as adding to inflationary forces although the majority felt that its likely stimulative effect on the economy would not be excessive one of these directors however the vice president of one of the largest upstate firms saw a greater danger of overstimulation from the projected deficit for fiscal 1973 than from the current years deficit the chairman of the board of a large new york city bank thought that the 87 billion of deficits compiled in three years could signal that huge deficits were becoming a fiscal way of life which would make inflation difficult to check while other directors also were concerned over current fiscal policy among the local businessmen contacted for an opinion on this issue the senior partner of a leading accounting firm felt that the lastminute disclosure of the size of the projected deficit has shaken public confidence and had left many businessmen dismayed a leading new york city banker doubted that expenditures and the deficit would reach projected levels but in any event felt that the release of these figures had generated uncertainty in the financial marketssentiments were mixed regarding the effectiveness of phase ii on balance the respondents felt that it was having a constructive effect most regarded the price commission as being more effective than the pay board in reducing inflationary pressures but a member expressed the opinion that the pay board has had some psychological effect in reducing the size as well as the number of wage increases demands a fact which is not reflected in statistics it releases among the specific comments made the president of a large copper firm said that the pay board hasnt demonstrated that it had things under control a feeling that was shared by the chairman of the board of a large new york city bank several of the buffalo branch directors pointed to apparent inequities in the boards rulings which they felt resulted from the use of different standards for particular labor groups on the other hand the president of a large liquor manufacturing firm reported that the board had been a definite factor in keeping down the wage increases for his firm in a recent wage settlement while a rochester businessman noted that fewer of his employees have been asking individually for wage increasesregarding the employment situation the vicepresident of one of the largest upstate firms expected the increases in hours worked to foreshadow additional hirings the job situation in rochester was reported to have shown a steady improvement since last may other directors and other business leaders however were unable to detect an improvement in the current unemployment picturewith respect to outlays for plant and equipment the directors and other business leaders expressing an opinion on this subject continued to look for little change in good part because of the high rate of unused capacitythe outlook for increased inventory outlays however seems to have improved on balance buffalo branch directors shared a feeling expressed by one of them that inventory downward adjustments have bottomed out moreover the local retailers that were contacted while reporting that january sales were below expectation in the new york city area in general looked for a good year and indicated that they were planning to increase their inventories accordingly a senior executive of new york citys largest department store was most optimistic and looked for a very very good yearconcerning the impact of the international currency realignments the buffalo branch directors felt these measures were a step in the right direction but that it was still too early to detect signs of an improvement in the competitive position of united states goods in world markets the chairman of the board of a large new york city bank expected no real change in the trade balance before 1972 other respondents felt that the realignments would ultimately have a favorable impact on their firms competitive positions but it was noted that they did not seem to have much effect on imports from japan
304,305,3-15-1972,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,a moderately more optimistic picture of the economic outlook as compared to last month emerged from opinions expressed by the directors of the new york bank and the buffalo branch and other businessmen consumer spending appears to have strengthened somewhat while business confidence was reported to have improved moderately the unemployment situation continues unsatisfactory but is apparently a little better than earlier in the yearconsumer spending which for the retail industry as a whole had been relatively sluggish in february seems to have quickened in the very recent past with scattered indications of increased sales of higher priced items among the directors a senior official of the largest upstate firm felt that the underlying trend of consumer spending has continued to improve and saw evidence of increased consumer willingness to tradeup in the strong sales of his firms new movie cameras a headoffice director referred to an acrosstheboard rise in airline travel and to a dramatic increase in domestic television sets sales while another director an upstate businessman noted that in his area sales of higher priced automobiles were rising more rapidly than those of cheaper models nevertheless most of the directors at both the head office and the buffalo branch did not discern any fundamental changes in consumers attitudes as yet among the retailers contacted an official of a highprice and highquality new york city department store with branches in the suburbs reported that following a rather sluggish performance earlier in the year sales by his firm had picked up noticeably so far in march and while he remained cautious he felt that 1972 would be a good year for his firm similarly the vicepresident of a large nationwide chain of department stores reported a strengthening in consumer demand at his firms stores in the recent past and notwithstanding the rather slow start earlier this year looked for a significantly better retail sales performance in 1972 as compared to 1971both for his firm and the retail trade industry in general finally an official of a mediumprice retail store chain which has experienced a gradual increase in business since last fall stated that he expects this trend to continue and noted that in the past month there had been a significant increase in his firms sale of bigticket items such as furniture and home appliancesalso encouraging was a report of some firming in business confidence among the buffalo branch directors the president of a rochester bank traced this strengthening to the slightly better profit outlook while the chairman of the board of a buffalo bank felt that the recent stock market strength mirrored an improved mood he also reported some pickup in machine tool orders in recent months in addition another upstate banker pointed to the relatively ambitious capital spending plans in his area while a senior official of a food processing company pointed to a recent sharp rise in farmers borrowings from agricultural financial institutions which he felt reflected a significant increase in farmers capital spending among the headoffice directors the chairman of a large new york city bank stated that there had been some general improvement in business confidence an upstate banker saw signs of willingness to spend on plant and equipment while a new jersey and an upstate new york banker both felt there had been a modest improvement in business confidence in their areas however at a meeting of business leaders held at this bank a senior official of a large nationwide conglomerate stated that while he looked for a rise in capital spending in certain industries other sectors such as the space and aircraft industries would not likely increase such outlays he also noted that most manufacturers are a bit wary and more reluctant than in the mid1960s to embark upon largescale capital outlays as in previous months some businessmen felt that most of the capital outlays would be largely limited to environmental control purposesthere was some evidence at this time of an upturn in inventory outlays the president of a large metal processing corporation reported some inventory buildup in the metal industry but primarily as a hedge against expected price increases in copper another director referred to a rebuilding of inventories in computer related lines the retailers that were contacted however all reported that while their firms were increasing inventories somewhat in view of their expectations of increased sales such outlays were being kept under tight control the current inventory outlook was perhaps best summed up at the buffalo branch directors meeting where it was noted that businesses had learned to live with lower inventories and are becoming less concerned about the occurrence of stockoutsalthough the respondents saw no dramatic changes in labor market conditions over the past month there were no further reports of costcutting layoffs and in fact several respondents saw some strengthening in the demand for labor particularly skilled workers some improvement thus was noted in the rochester area while a senior official of the largest upstate firm observed that unemployment rates for experienced workers were trending down the new jersey banker stated that there had been a fair improvement in the job market in his area and that it was harder to get qualified workers a similar sentiment regarding skilled workers had also been expressed by a senior official of the countrys largest communication firm finally a director reported that his companys efforts to improve productivity through reductions in production workers had been somewhat overdone and that his firm was now increasing its work force by a few hundred workers on the other hand a number of respondents looked for little change in the unemployment picture in the near future the official of the large manufacturing conglomerate did not expect a quick rebound in manufacturing employment while the chairman of a large department store chain expressed the belief that unemployment benefits and high welfare payments are geared to keep the unemployment rate high
316,317,4-12-1972,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the directors of the new york bank and the buffalo branch in general felt phase ii still was having a favorable if not fully adequate impact on current economic developments and that the resignation of the four labor members would not cripple the pay board most of the directors as well as the retailers who were contacted continue to be moderately optimistic on balance about the retail sales outlook views expressed by the directors however on the whole suggested that some cooling of the housing boom may be in the offing according to most responses of the directors and of a number of bank officials business loan demand has continued sluggishalthough the directors at both the buffalo branch and the head office were not especially enthusiastic over the impact so far of phase ii they generally agreed that the presidents program was having some effect in restraining inflation those buffalo branch directors who expressed an opinion agreed that the current situation would have been far worse without these measures but they felt that more stringent action would probably be needed to bring inflation under fuller control the vicepresident of a large upstate firm pointed to the slowing down in the rate of growth of nonfood prices so far this year and similar sentiments were expressed by the president of an upstate banka head office director the chairman of the board of a large new york city bank felt that phase ii had been fairly effective and he also remarked that the pay board had done a fairly creditable job in view of the nasty problems it had faced much the same view was expressed by the president of a large nationwide manufacturing concern all but one of the directors who commented on the subject felt that the departure of the four labor members would not cripple the pay board indeed some of the buffalo branch directors thought that this move might result in smoother board operation a new jersey banker however reported that his staff foresaw more strikes and a complete breakdown of the efforts of the pay boardthe recent consumer spending picture has been somewhat blurred by the early easter holiday which tended to boost march sales possibly at the expense of april sales in any event the directors and the retailers who were contacted still present a moderately optimistic picture particularly with respect to the coming months it is true that the president of a rochester department store a head office director characterized current retail sales in that area as only fair and buffalo branch directors reported only slightly better performance in western new york this easter period relative to last year in each case however these directors said that businessmen in their area expected sales to pick up as the year progressed an official of a high price high quality new york city department store who last month had reported a spurt in business by his firm in early march was more restrained this month he noted that while sales were still picking up the rise was only moderate and smaller than had been hoped however he still remained cautiously optimistic and he felt that 1972 would turn out to be a fairly good year up to his stores expectations and better than 1971 an official of a nationwide chain of mediumpriced stores on the other hand verged on the exuberant he reported that his firms business had been picking up smartly that the increased strength in the demand for bigger ticket items he had noted last month continued in evidence and that his firm was very pleased and looking for a good year the president of the large nationwide manufacturing concern viewed the strength in his firms corrugated container sales as signaling a rise in consumer demandregarding residential construction the overall impression emerging from the views expressed by the directors was that on balance it continues strong but that some flatteningout may be in the offing an upstate banker reported a considerable amount of apartment and singlefamily dwelling construction in his area a new york city banker remarked that a slight rise in the rate of vacancies might not be an unfavorable development as it might tend to reduce upward pressures on rents the senior official of the large upstate firm looked for some cooling off of the boom in residential construction as a result of a slight rise in the rate of vacancies and in mortgage rates buffalo branch directors reported some concern on the part of builders that supply would soon exceed demand partly in the case of rochester as the result of a number of urban development projects now underwayreports concerning the strength of business loan demand varied somewhat but on balance pointed to continued relative sluggishness on the one hand the new york city bankerdirector reported that demand at his bank was up to levels experienced in a good year and an upstate bankerdirector noted an uptrend of all types of loans at his bank in recent weeks on the other hand a rochester banker a buffalo branch director while characterizing demand as fairly good at his own bank indicated that reports from the rochester area suggested such demand continues weak similarly a new jersey banker reported no pronounced increase in the demand for business loans at his bank these latter assessments are consistent with the results of a special survey of five new york city banks and four other district banks four of the five new york city banks reported no or only seasonal increases in business loans over the past month as did three of the four outoftown banks a key reason advanced for this weakness was that business generally appeared to be in a fairly liquid position thus obviating the need for bank credit at this time
328,329,5-17-1972,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,opinions expressed by head office and buffalo branch directors and other business leaders point to further advances in economic activity plant and equipment spending is apparently being upgraded consumer confidence is improving and the demand for business loans is strengthening the unemployment situation however while improving slightly remains far from satisfactorymost respondents looked for a further upgrading of plant and equipment spending over the balance of the year but were more restrained regarding the strength of the upswing than suggested by recent surveys among the head office directors the chairman of the board of a large new york city bank thought the capital expenditures outlook was good but not as favorable as the mcgrawhill survey indicated the president of a large nonferrous metal firm stated that recent reports of an upgrading of plans for capital outlays may be fairly accurate but could not confirm these on the basis of his business own experience the buffalo branch directors felt the tone in the capital goods sector was taking a turn for the better and reported that a number of small businesses were expanding facilities and that the demand for improved equipment was particularly strong however a rochester retailer a head office director stated that while the largest upstate firm was adhering to current expansion plans several other companies were planning cutbacks opinions expressed by some business leaders were also less optimistic a senior official of a large electric equipment firm said talk about heavy capital spending was not reflected in his firms heavy machinery business which was slowas noted in last months report the marchapril retail sales picture has been somewhat blurred by the early easter which favorably affected march sales nevertheless the views expressed by most respondents on balance point to the emergence of a brighter consumer spending picture most of the buffalo directors thus reported a pickup in retail sales following a somewhat disappointing easter season in western new york and these directors felt that consumers moods had brightened most reported local retailers are expecting to meet 1972 sales projections as consumer demand continues to strengthen among the head office directors the large new york city banker found the retail picture fairly encouraging and the rochester retailer was optimistic about the outlook despite the fact current business in the buffalorochestersyracuse area was not good the vice president of a large nationwide chain of department stores reported that sales in both march and april had been good indeed better than his firms expectations and that on the basis of preliminary reports the trend was continuing in early may he noted special strength in home appliances and furnishings presumably linked to the occupancy of new housing in his view the consumers have not become reasonably confident and his firm was optimistic regarding the remainder of the year moreover indirect indications of gathering strength in consumer sales were also evident in the comments of several manufacturers thus the senior official of the electric equipment firm reported their consumer goods sales were moving well in some areas with considerable strength while the president of an upstate manufacturing firm reported a significant pickup in his companys sales of auto partsthose directors who expressed an opinion on the business loan situation reported a strengthening in such credit primarily related to construction projects three of the buffalo branch bankers pointed to the increase in loans to finance the construction of multiple dwellings units including condominiums one of these directors while noting the strong demand for construction credit referred to the sluggishness in demand from national firms which he felt were raising needed funds in the equity and bond markets rather than drawing on their credit lines some of the respondents expected an eventual improvement accumulation would bring further increases in the demand for business loans with respect to other types of loans among the head office directors the president of an upstate bank reported a strong demand for credit in his area especially in mortgage loans for new apartments but also for new factories while the chairman of the large new york city bank stated that loans to finance companies and real estate loans have been particularly heavythe directors felt that some improvementalbeit scattered and as yet limitedwas occurring in the unemployment situation the president of the metal producing corporation reported that there seems to be some improvement in arizona and california and pointed to the fractional rise in march and april in help wanted advertising in the west and southwest the new york city banker felt the situation had improved slightly but remarked that a decline in the overall unemployment rate was difficult because of the sizable influx of new entrants into the work force the buffalo branch directors generally agreed that there had been some recent improvement in the local employment situation but noted that this must be viewed against the high unemployment rates prevailing during the winter they noted that the local picture was still not goodwhile skilled workers were again in demand unemployment among the unskilled would continue to plague the area
340,341,6-14-1972,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,according to directors of the head office and the buffalo branch and other business leaders phase ii on balance has been relatively successful in curbing the wageprice spiral new developments in vietnam have had little or no impact on business and consumer confidence the recent retail sales picture seemed somewhat less bright than last months and businesses continue to follow very cautious inventory policiesconcerning phase ii respondents current assessments varied somewhat but can perhaps best be summed up by the view of a head office director chairman of the board of a new jersey bank who stated it had both its good and bad aspects and while a wage problem still existed it was not as serious as last years among other head office directors a senior official of a large new york city bank gave the program a for effort and b for performance and felt there would be a phase iii the president of a large nonferrous metalproducing corporation thought the program was hurting corporate profits and thus making return on investment inadequate by controlling prices more effectively than wages a senior official of a major metal container firm however felt phase ii has helped slow the inflationary spiral and on the basis of his firms experience has been a definite factor in curbing the magnitude of wage increases a rochester department store official stated that but for controls wages in his area would skyrocket buffalo branch directors generally agreed controls had been reasonably effective and given the number of labor contracts expiring next year such controls would probably be required for at least another year among other respondents the chairman of a large nonbank financial firm characterized phase ii as a brilliant stroke but regretfully felt it to be but the first step toward more controls a former senior official of this bank while not assessing the program as brilliant stated he was surprised by how well it was workingaccording to most respondents recent military developments in vietnam have had little or no impact on business and consumer confidence as will be noted below however some respondents mentioned the situation as a factor possibly slowing the gradual rise in retail sales that has been under way since last fallindeed the current consumer spending picture that emerges from the views expressed by respondents appears less bright than last months buffalo branch directors viewed retail sales in western new york as holding steady with only minor seasonal fluctuations a leading rochester retailer characterized the current retail sales picture in his area as indifferent and reported only guarded optimism among retailers regarding the outlook for the next few months he felt consumers still lacked confidence perhaps because of vietnam or because of the wage controls the container manufacturer also was not optimistic over nearterm retail sales prospects for a number of reasons including the uncertainties created by vietnam the effects of phase ii and the coming elections he felt the adverse impact of these factors on consumer confidence being accentuated by the manner in which they have been handled by the news media the president of a nationwide chain of variety stores stated consumer spending had not been buoyant this spring and the consumer is not carrying the economy yet this feeling was shared by the president of a popular priced textile manufacturer who however looked for a gradual pickup over the balance of the year a senior official of a high priced high quality new york city department store reported his firms business had been fairly good in may and had picked up further in early june he expected a continued moderate increase in sales over the coming months but felt consumers remained restrained and reported his firm was only cautiously optimisticthis relatively lackluster consumer spending picture found its counterpart in reports of a continued lack of strength in business inventories some businessmen commented that with the help of computers to determine the minimum required users and retailers did not wish to tie up working capital to carry excess inventories the department store official mentioned above stated his firms inventories were currently somewhat heavier than at this time last year but they were not crazy over this situation and were actually trying to reduce them the rochester retailer reported stores in his area also were continually attempting to control inventories the nonferrous metal producer reported no increase in copper inventories the container manufacturer also saw no inventory increases in that industry a new york city banker saw little evidence of strength in the inventory picture in his bank loan developments while its total loans are well ahead of last years the increase has not been accounted for by industrial and commercial loans similar views were expressed by the new jersey banker and buffalo branch directors almost all felt there appeared to be no strengthening in business inventories the only exception was the director of the upstate food

352,353,7-18-1972,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,opinions on the current economic outlook expressed recently by the banks directors and other business leaders were mixed but on the whole gave a somewhat more optimistic overall picture than last month despite the adverse effects of bad weather conditions in june including widespread damage in the district area as the result of hurricane agnes a number of respondents felt that consumer confidence was strengthening further and that somewhat more liberal inventories buying policies were being pursued there were also reports of improvements in the unemployment situation in some areas in general little concern was expressed over the current international monetary disturbances nor over the uncertainties related to the developing discussions of federal income tax reformsconcerning the current business outlook most of the head office directors did not change their recent assessment in general they foresaw continued expansion of economic activity over the coming months and someif not altogether satisfactorysuccess of phase ii in curbing the wageprice spiral one director an upstate banker pointed to the adverse effect of the hurricane on the tourist trade in his area and to the extensive crop damage which he feared would have a definite effect upon food supplies later in the year a rochester retailer felt that the recent flooding would adversely affect retail sales for one or two months but he expected a resumption of normal activity thereafter the responding buffalo branch directors on the other hand all indicated a more sanguine view in different degrees of the business outlook in their areas they based their revised outlook variously on increased retail sales heavy construction activity loan demand andin the view of one directorinflationary fiscal policies that at least in the short run were exerting upward pressures on the economy repairs of the flood damages were also mentioned as a stimulating factora distinctly more optimistic outlook was also evident in the tone of the responses of the senior officials of retail firms we usually contact in new york city to be sure in their view the bad weather conditions in june had temporarily acted to slow down the gradual rate of growth in consumer outlays that has been underway over the past year in general however they felt that consumer confidence would continue to strengthen and they looked toward a good year while still closely controlling inventories they were now gradually increasing them one official who a few months ago reported that his firm would rather risk losing some sales because of stockouts rather than increase inventories now stated that current policy was to be reasonably certain an adequate supply of merchandise was on hand in order not to lose potential businessa few respondents showed some concern over the latest upheaval in the foreign exchange markets but the majority did not feel that the current international monetary situation was having any serious impact on current domestic economic developments some of the retailers however did mention encountering some difficulties as a result of the uncertainties regarding the exact dollar cost of their imported lines of merchandisewith respect to the possible decisionmaking impact of the developing discussion over federal tax reforms most respondents either expressed no opinion or felt it was too early to affect business decisions some directors discounted this discussion as election rhetoric one director felt that instead of inhibiting business capital outlays the reverse might be the case as businesses sought to take advantage of favorable tax treatment now while it was still available some buffalo branch directors however reported continued concern on the part of businessmen over the heavy and increasing burden of new york state and local taxes
364,365,8-9-1972,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,according to the directors of this bank and of the buffalo branch the recent business inventory picture on balance has become moderately brighter and there have been scattered signs of a further strengthening in business plant and equipment spending plans the directors however saw little recent change in the unemployment situation except for a sharp improvement in those areas of the district where repairs of the extensive damage caused by hurricane agnes were underway most expressed concern over the wageprice outlook particularly if the controls are allowed to expireregarding business inventory policies the respondents felt that the longawaited rise in business inventory accumulation appeared to have gathered some if limited momentum over the past month while in the view of some of the directors business inventory policies have remained on the cautious side others reported some rise in both manufacturing and trade inventories the president of a large metalproducing firm characterized the rate of accumulation among metal users as moderate he said most manufacturers in this field felt that the current level of unused capacity in the metalproducing industry would make it possible to meet any rise in demand through increased production other directors while reporting some increase in inventories felt that the buildup was not commensurate with the rise in economic activity they attributed this to improved inventory control spurred in part by the relatively high level of interest rates and to the fact that business had learned to live with lower inventories thus the vice president of the largest upstate new york firm stated that both trade and manufacturing inventories were on the rise although not rapidly enough to keep ahead of sales similar views were expressed by the chairman of a sizeable new jersey bankalthough most of the respondents saw no dramatic change in the recent past in business plant and equipment plans the overall assessment of developments in this sector apparently continued to brighten on the whole among the buffalo branch directors a banker referred to the announcement of a major steel corporation that it was planning fairly large capital spending at its upstate facilities while another banker pointed to relatively large expansion programs in his area by two corporations the senior official of the largest upstate firm was the most optimistic indicating that his firms capital budget might rise substantially in 1973responses regarding the unemployment situation were mixed the head office directors in general saw little improvement in a generally soft job market particularly with respect to the availability of summer jobs for students however a director did point to one exceptionthe coal industrywhere he felt the employment outlook for experienced workers was very good an upstate banker saw some firmness in the employment situation in his area while some of the buffalo branch directors reported a pronounced improvement in the employment picture in those areas where extensive repairs of damages resulting from hurricane agnes were underwaymost directors expressed concern over the price and wage outlook based among other things on the pending increase in social security benefits the impact of the proposed rise in the legal minimum wage the heavy 1973 calendar of union negotiations and even on the upcoming union election in the coal industry which a directorthe president of a large metal producing corporationfelt would result in wholly unrealistic wage increase demands the branch directors did feel that under phase ii price and wage increases were at a lower rate than previously however they expressed concern over what would happen when the control expired unless some other ground rules to curb labor demands were adopted
376,377,9-13-1972,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the views of this banks head office and buffalo branch directors on the economic situation and outlook remain about unchanged on balance the directors believe the recovery is continuing and they remain reasonably optimistic about the outlook the primary concern voiced about the future was the prospect for worsening inflation it was stressed that the collective bargaining calendar for 1973 is heavy the federal deficit is large and widening and that wage and price controls might be dismantled prematurely on the brighter side several directors cited evidence of a strong capital spending outlook for 1973 and there were a number of comments that indicated further improvement in the local employment picturethe performance of retail sales were generally pictured as little changed from the recent past retail demand was described as strong in new york city rochester and jamestown one banker director did say his information indicated a somewhat mixed picture in the upstate area but went on to attribute that to special local factors such as bad weather several directors also observed that retail sales are generally stronger in the suburbs than in the central cities and that backtoschool buying had been encouragingconcerning prospective business plant and equipment outlays several directors felt such outlays would rise rapidly in 1973 an upstate banker said he expected very strong capital spending on the basis of his banks loan commitments for pay out in the first half of next year a senior official of the largest upstate firm also expressed confidence that capital spending would show an impressive gain in part as a result of the ample availability of both external and internal funds the president of a major oil company saw the possibility for an improvement next year in his industrys capital spending picture following the drop that had occurred in 1972 another director also foresaw continued rapid growth of capital outlays by municipal governments on the other hand one upstate banker stated that he did not look for a significant upgrading of existing capital spending plans and an upstate manufacturer pointed to the current level of unused capacity as well as to the uncertainties related to the election as factors currently inhibiting the expansion of capital spending plans also the president of a large metal producing firm stated he was not bullish with respect to plant and equipment spending in the metals industry in part because of continued excess capacity and depressed profitsthe directors with some exceptions felt the current demand for commercial and industrial bank loans was not particularly strong the major exception was the chairman of the board of a large new york city bank who stated that there had been a substantial pickup in commercial and industrial loans at his bank since midyear an upstate banker reported some strengthening in connection with a continued rapid growth of capital outlays by municipalities the new jersey banker reported a good loan demand from local businesses but noted that borrowings at his bank by national corporations has as yet remained modest also several upstate bankers characterized current commercial and industrial loan demand as quite soft one of these bankers however said the current weakness might be seasonal and that he was expecting a strengthening in demand in the coming months the senior official of the largest upstate firm also felt loan demand was picking up but not as rapidly as might be expected in the light of the pace of the economic recoverya fact he attributed in good part to the current highly liquid positions of many large corporations similarly an upstate manufacturer observed that current industrial cash flow seemed sufficient to fill normal financial needs the president of the major oil company reported that bank credit to the petroleum industry had been declining since mid1969 partly because of increased reliance of those firms on the commercial paper marketthe responses concerning the employment picture were encouraging continued strength was reported in the rochester area where there is now a shortage of skilled personnel especially in the construction industry a similar assessment was made by the new jersey banker who as an example reported that his bank has had difficulties in obtaining people to build a new bank building and the president of the major metal producing firm noted that the employment situation in the coal industry has continued to improvefinally broad concern was expressed by the directors over the outlook for wage and price inflation references were made variously to the unhealthy federal budget situation to the heavy collective bargaining calendar for 1973 and the possible pacesetting effect of large wage settlements recently negotiated in canada to the prospect for higher gasoline and heating oil prices later this year as supplies run short and to fears that existing wage and price controls might shortly be scrapped
388,389,10-11-1972,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the relatively optimistic mood of this banks directors regarding the current general business outlook remained in evidence this month the directors felt that residential construction activity would remain at a high level in 1973 and that consumers outlays would continue on the upswing the consensus was that there had been little change in the rather conservative inventory buying practices but this was largely attributed to more efficient management with the help of computers concern however continued to be expressed over the inflationary implications of the federal budget and labor unions large wage demandsregarding the overall current economic outlook the directors in general felt that the current and prospective business situation had undergone little change recently and reported a generally optimistic mood among themselves and their associates indeed the president of an upstate bank reported some heightening of optimism in his area as a result of a reduction in local unemployment and another upstate director noted that apart from certain segments in agriculture and tourism that had been adversely affected by poor weather all other economic sectors in his area looked very strong concern however continued to be expressed over the inflationary implication of the fiscal and wage situation a rochester retailer thus noted the necessity for additional taxes to finance even current government expenditures and another director referred to the urgent need to develop new federal budget controls an upstate manufacturer remarked that continued wage controls seemed to be a necessary evil if the problem of costpush inflation were to be solvedconcerning residential construction the directors expressing an opinion on the topic all felt that homebuilding would continue to be relatively strong in 1973 some of the directors forecast a continuation of the popularity of multipledwelling units and strength in apartment building activity one director noted that the damage caused earlier this year in his area by a hurricane and floods was generating an unusually large amount of construction of new homes and of reconstruction of existing structures another director reported that homebuilders in the rochester area felt that expected ample availability of mortgage funds would contribute sustained strength to home construction next yearregarding consumer outlays most respondents characterized the picture as good but not spectacular and about in line with expectations one directorthe president of a large container manufacturing firmfelt the situation was very good a senior official of a large upstate firm also felt that a boom in consumer spending while not as yet evident might materialize next springthe directors however in general saw little if any strengthening in the current inventory picture in either trade or manufacturing an upstate director associated with the automotive parts business did state he detected an upward trend and the rochester retailer also felt the overall pace of inventory spending looked a bit stronger the latter director however suggested that some of the accumulation in the retail sector in the rochester area might be involuntary another director suggested that recent published statistics pointing to a climb in inventory spending might be misleading because such increases may in part at least reflect the impact on the book value of inventories of rising pricesanother director stated that the high cost of carrying inventories was tempering the demand for additional stocks also a number of directors noted that computerbased control systems enabled businesses to carry inventories at lower levels
400,401,11-14-1972,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,in the view of most of this banks directors and other business leaders recently contacted the new federal revenue sharing program is likely to result in increased state and local government outlays over the nearterm rather than tax reductions a ceasefire in vietnam was expected to have little impact on the current business situation since that outcome was believed to have already been largely discounted respondents in general were optimistic over the retail sales outlook for the christmas season business hiring practices remain on the conservative side with additions to payrolls still geared to current rather than expected future needsin the view of most directors the recently enacted measure providing for substantial federal revenue sharing with state and local authorities could be expected to quickly stimulate increased outlays by these governmental units buffalo branch directors felt the measure would have a bail out effect enabling state and local governments to meet demands from organized employee groups and other civic pressure groups they also reported there were indications a number of localities intended to use part of the payments to undertake capital expenditures that had earlier been deferred for lack of funds one director felt the measure would have a substantial spending impact that would be reinforced by the current strong cyclical rise in local taxes although some of the directors did not rule out the possibility that the program would lead initially to some local tax reductionor a moderation of increasesthe general feeling was that the lions share of the available funds would be used to finance projects that had been postponed earlier due to a lack of funds on the other hand one new jersey banker felt the revenue sharing measure would neither contribute to increased spending nor reduced taxes in the financially pressed cities in his area but rather that a good deal of the funds would be used to liquidate outstanding debtmost of the directors agreed that a ceasefire in vietnam would have little immediate impact on business and consumer spending since that eventuality had already been discounted a few of the directors however did feel such a settlement would contribute to an aura of stability by finally eliminating the major uncertainty that has adversely affected business and consumer attitudes over the past several years the consumer sector was viewed as the area where vietnam agreement would have its major impactconcerning consumer spending respondents in general continued to express an optimistic outlook a senior official of a new york city department store specializing in highpriced highquality goods and having branches in the suburbs reported that his firms october sales had been very good and that he expected a higher level of business during this christmas season than last years the chairman of the board of a rochester department store who previously had frequently been rather skeptical over the consumer spending picture reported that retailers in his area were expecting holiday sales to run well ahead of a year ago indeed he felt that the consumer is likely to spend a larger share of his income in the coming months the new jersey banker reported that retailers in his area were looking toward a good christmas season the buffalo branch directors expressed views regarding the consumer spending outlook that while varying in degree were unanimously optimisticthe directors were unable to detect any trend toward more aggressive hiring practices in private industry it was however noted that the earlier belt tightening phase had come to an end and that with the continued upswing in business activity the need for additional employees was starting to build
412,413,12-19-1972,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,reports from our directors and other business leaders recently contacted indicate that economic activity remains very strong respondents cited the high and improving degree of business confidence and described the outlook for 1973 in generally favorable termsmost respondents characterized retail sales as very good now that the holiday season is underway the chairman of the board of a rochester department store who earlier had been somewhat skeptical about consumer spending said that christmas sales were likely to outpace last years showing by a wide margin and this view seemed to be generally shared a director of the buffalo branch attributed the buoyancy of consumer spending to the expectation of a vietnam settlement increased personal income the removal of election uncertainties and the stability accompanying wageprice controlsthe economic outlook for 1973 was described as favorable by all respondents although the degree of optimism varied in the view of most directors production sales and employment are expected to show further advances one director felt that the growth in output and employment would be almost as rapid as the gains experienced this year several respondents said that production is likely to outpace sales because of the need to rebuild inventories on the other hand a director associated with the metals industry commented that inventory accumulation by the metalsusing industries was being held down by the continued presence of considerable excess capacity and a weak price outlook a director of the buffalo branch who is a senior official of a large upstate manufacturer suggested that unemployment will average about 5 percent for 1973 as a whole he added that wage increases might moderate a bit but that advances in prices will probably be about the same as in 1972in this connection almost all of the respondents were agreed that wageprice controls would remain necessary next year a bank chairman said the program should be maintained for at least a while longer although he felt that it should not become a permanent feature of the economy another director said that the program at least in some form should be continued for another 9 to 12 months only one director associated with the metals industry expressed reservations about the program he said that the metals industry favors eliminating the controls and noted that fluctuations in uncontrolled raw materials prices combined with controls on the prices of final products had resulted in distortions and inefficiencies in overall pricingall of the directors detected a high and improving degree of business confidence in the economic situation but the current state of confidence was described in terms that fell short of exuberance changes in inventory spending were variously described as minimal to robust one director said that inventory controls were still very tight while another in the automobile parts business said that inventory spending is increasing sharply as a result of a tightening supply situation and slower deliveries several respondents noted that there was some progress in implementing capital spending programs which earlier had been slowed down or held in abeyance pending clarification of the overall economic outlookthe chairman of a large new york bank said there are signs of serious overbuilding of apartments in some parts of the country and was concerned about the proliferation and credit status of real estate investment trusts and land development companies he suggested that these enterprises may represent the one significant weakness in our overall credit structure another director thought that overbuilding would become a national problem if housing starts remained at their high 1972 level however he expected a reduction in housing starts of about 10 percent during 1973 because of shortages of building materials and reduced availability of mortgage money and felt that this would prevent overbuilding from becoming a general problem
424,425,1-10-1973,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,an optimistic tone regarding the economic outlook characterized the views expressed by second district directors and other leading businessmen contacted recently retailers enjoyed a very good christmas season business confidence was reported to have strengthened further but no signs of an emerging boom psychology were detected apart from isolated instances industrial product markets have not tightened any further of late and in general industrial prices have risen only in response to production cost increases the unemployment picture has improved on balance and growing shortages of skilled and semiskilled workers were reportedmost respondents reported that holiday sales in their area had been exceptionally goodwell above yearago levels and also generally well above earlier expectations the president of a large retail concern with nationwide outlets said his firms sales during this period had exceeded expectations which were already very high to begin with one director observed that sales during the week after christmas were also unusually good presumably indicating that consumers were still in a bargainhunting moodthe buffalo branch directors felt the current wellbalanced expansion has given businessmen an optimistic outlook with expectations now widespread that growth would continue throughout 1973 a senior official of a large upstate manufacturer who felt that business confidence had improved greatly of late said this development was now being translated into increased orders inventories and plant and equipment outlays the president of a large retail firm also felt that strength in the overall business situation was likely to continue over the months ahead generally similar sentiments were expressed by other directors and business leaders concern however continued to be voiced by some of the respondents over the uncertainties surrounding wageprice controls and government spendingregarding the raw materials and industrial products markets a majority of the directors detected no widespread tightening in these markets at this time although there were reports of scattered tight spots however the senior official of the large upstate industrial firm did state that while the most outstanding example of tightness so far was in the lumber industry conditions in other industries might become tighter if price controls prevent normal market forces from expanding supplies several other directors also reported that building materials were in short supply and an upstate owneroperator of a large agricultural enterprise commented that paperboard and some textile products seemed harder to obtain it was also reported that delivery of raw materials in the automotive parts business has stretched out from the normal three to four weeks to seven to eight weeks the new jersey banker reported that several firms in his area were adding second and third shifts to keep output in line with incoming orderson the price front respondents expressing an opinion stated that they were not aware of any increases in industrial prices which did not appear to be directly related to cost increases with respect to agricultural prices however an upstate director engaged in agriculture noted that short supply and high demand had resulted in drastically increased prices for apples and for livestock and poultry feeds the latter being reflected in higher milk and egg pricesaccording to most respondents there is no general shortage of labor in the second district but conditions are tight in scattered localities and widespread shortages of skilled workers exist the labor market in the rochester area was said to be quite tight with a large number of vacancies open for skilled labor labor conditions in albany also were described as tight reflecting in part the continued growth in governmentrelated employment a new jersey banker not only reported a shortage of skilled bluecollar workers in his area but noted that there was some difficulty in obtaining employees in the banking field as well most other directors also mentioned shortages of skilled workers
437,438,2-7-1973,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,in the view of this banks directors and other business leaders contacted recently the vietnam accord may have a beneficial psychological influence on consumer confidence but in general is not expected to have any major economic impact the respondents reacted cautiously but favorably to phase iii which was viewed as heralding eventual elimination of wage and price controls they also approved of the administrations budget policy but in general felt it would be difficult to implement in the face of congressional pressures little noticeable change in business inventory policies was reportedthe second district directors generally agreed that most of the peace dividend accruing from the vietnam settlement had already been realized with a number of the directors pointing to the insignificant involvement of american troops in the war over the past several months these directors moreover did not look for a resulting cut in federal spending both because of expected united states economic help to north and south vietnam and increased military pay one director however felt that defense expenditures during fiscal 1974 could be significantly reduced through a reduction in military personnel he said this might occur since with the changeover to an allvolunteer army the actual number of volunteers may fall short of the levels planned in the defense budgetthe respondents in general reacted rather favorably to the modifications of the wageprice controls under phase iii viewing it as an important step toward the eventual elimination of price and wage controls in this context several directors felt these changes were particularly welcome in the light of the distortions and inequities that were emerging under phase ii a number of respondents however recognized that inflationary pressures continued strong and that some form of controls was probably still necessary one director a senior official of a large oil corporation stated that wages and prices may increase somewhat faster under phase iii but that the rise could be held to modest proportions if sound monetary and fiscal policies are pursued however another director a banker thought that the administrations estimates of inflation were somewhat optimistic and saw inflation during 1973 in the range of 3 to 5 percent and probably closer to the higher figure several respondents stated that the results of forthcoming major labor negotiations would play an important role in determining the success of the programall of the directors reacted favorably to the administrations budget strategy a number referred to the need for fiscal restraint in the light of the current economic situation the buffalo branch directors felt the strategy would gather widespread public support these directors however along with the head office directors had reservations regarding the administrations ability to keep expenditures in line with the proposed budget in the face of congressional oppositionmost directors did not report any discernible change in inventory buying policies the president of a nationwide retail firm expressed the view that retail firms were not accumulating inventories as a hedge against inflation at this time on the other hand the president of a large metals producing firm did report that there was now evidence of inventory accumulation in metals in anticipation of further price increasesthe director associated with the oil industry said that petroleum inventories were severely depleted as a result of very strong demand a leveling off in domestic production and inadequate levels of imports against this background he fears the nation may be facing a serious gasoline shortage later in the year
449,450,3-14-1973,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the second district directors and other business leaders contacted recently remained generally optimistic about the prospect for business activity over the foreseeable future and the respondents in general felt that the recent devaluation of the dollar would have a favorable impact on the countrys economy however concern over the balanceofpayments situation remained very much in evidence phase iii was not expected to modify the rosy corporate profits outlook but considerable doubt was expressed regarding its workability with respect to wage controls evidence of increasing strains on productive capacity were noted and widespread concern was voiced over prospects for controlling inflationregarding the recent devaluation of the dollar several bankers did not anticipate that this move would have an immediate effect on their own business but felt that the economy generally would benefit over the longer run as more united states products are sold both domestically and abroad a senior official of a large multinational manufacturing firm headquartered in upstate new york predicted that the devaluation would stimulate foreign sales of multinational companies with an accompanying reduction in the countrys international balance of payment deficit later in the year the vice chairman of a large nonferrous metal producer stated that the recent foreign exchange moves had been helpful to his firmsome respondents on the other hand were more restrained and others expressed concern over the uncertainties that they felt continued to surround the current international financial situation the president of a large multinational petroleum producer stated that the devaluation had no major immediate impact on his firm similarly the president of a lead importing corporation felt the devaluation did not involve his firm very much further the owner of a large fruit growing concerna directorstated he did not expect the devaluation to have any effects on the fruit growing business nor on any agricultural lines oriented to domestic consumption as noted a number of respondents expressed general concern over the balance of payments picture citing the need for reform of the international monetary system a number were especially concerned over the japanese situation with this view most strongly expressed by one respondent who declared that the japanese are the heart of the problemturning to the domestic picture it was the consensus of the buffalo branch directors that phase iii had not altered the favorable outlook for corporate profits this year also those directors did not expect phase iii to result in any significant shift in plant and equipment spending they noted the uncertainties created by the new approach but felt that the elimination of the red tape associated with phase ii more than made up for the unfavorable effect of these uncertainties on the other hand some respondents were quite dubious regarding the wage side of the control program an upstate banker a director felt that a double standard was being usedone for organized labor and a more stringent one for nonunion workers the lead importer mentioned above stated he expected phase iii to break down in the area of wages the nonferrous metal producer felt the new program had contributed to a seven week strike in his firms southern facilities inasmuch as the firm had been close to signing a contract when the phase iii bombshell hitwith respect to shortages of raw materials and manufactured goods most comments on specific products focused on shortages of lumber products in part these shortages were attributed to the export of wood products as a result of the price control program which according to the respondents made such exports more profitable than domestic sales also reduction in wood product supply and rises in production costs were attributed to new ecology standards and to the activities of conservationist organizations apart from the wood products industries however the directors saw no direct indication of shortages and no evidence of inventory stock piling in anticipation of such shortages but they felt that higher prices and longer delivery schedules pointed to increasing strains on productive capacityagainst this background many respondents expressed alarm over the possibility of a return to surging inflation most directors cited this prospect as one of the major problems they foresaw on the economic and financial horizon the opinions of other business leaders were perhaps best expressed by the chairman of a large financial institution who commented everything is tending toward inflation
461,462,4-11-1973,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the second district directors that were recently contacted continued to point to a strong business outlook consumer spending and business plant and equipment outlays were said to have remained at a high level and the devaluation of the dollar in general was expected to lead to an improved international trade balance however there were continued reports of further tightening in labor markets of growing shortages of fuel and raw materials and of imbalances between the demand and supply of food which current consumer resistance to high food prices would do little to correct as a result concern over mounting inflationary pressures and skepticism over the capability of phase 3 to cope with such pressures continued to be expressedretail sales were reported as generally strong and it was noted that the income tax refunds now being paid would provide added stimulus in the months ahead one director felt that the currently high level of auto saleswhich he characterized as of boom proportionsin part reflected some buying ahead in anticipation of higher prices resulting from the additional antipollution and safety equipment scheduled for the 1974 and 1975 models as in previous months a number of directors reported that retail sales were stronger in the suburban shopping areas than in innercity outlets one director noted the recent softening of consumer confidence probably reflecting concern over inflation indicated in some recent surveys however this director felt that consumer spending would nonetheless be strongthe trend of business plant and equipment spending was also characterized as strong by a number of directors a similar assessment was implicit in reports of the buffalo branch directors who observed that while there seemed to be a pervasive gloominess among businessmen in their area these same businessmen were forecasting continued strength in their own companies performances the chairman of the board of a large oil company noted the adverse effect of environmental controls on capital outlays in the petroleum industry which were severely hampering the construction of deep ports to accommodate super tankers new drilling operations and the construction of the alaska pipe linea number of directors reported that employment has continued at a high level in their area with the availability of certain types of workers falling short of demand a senior official of a large upstate manufacturer felt that the job market in general was gradually tightening with skilled workers in short supply two upstate bankers characterized employment as at a very high level with continued tight market conditions expected for the balance of the year another respondent noted that unemployment in the buffalo area still remained relatively high but looked for this situation to improve as steel and auto plants increased hiring however most directors commenting on the employment outlook for students this summer took a gloomy view of prospects in that area partly because of cutbacks in federally funded student summer employment programs some of the directors observed that substantial youth unemployment over the summer was one of the most serious problems facing cities in their areas the senior official of the large upstate manufacturing firm however felt that the outlook for student employment this summer was probably the best since 1969there were also further reports of growing raw material shortages including petroleum products wood products and nonferrous metals in the latter context the president of a multinational nonferrous metals producing corporation reported there were indications that hot money had moved into the future markets for such metals the same director also stated that widespread raw material shortagesrather than plant capacityseemed likely to lead to production bottlenecks over the coming months and that the energy crisis was the single most important problem on the economic horizonconcerning the impact of the recent dollar devaluation a new york city banker reported that this move would tend to produce a one shot increase in his institutions earnings by virtue of its effect on income from its overseas investments he expressed concern however over the extent to which this development might give rise over the long run to more widespread use of controls on the international flow of funds the official of the oil company reported that the recent international monetary steps should eventually help improve the countrys trade balance although he felt labor costs and productivity remained the crucial factors in any lasting improvement according to this director one immediate effect of the devaluation has been to exert significant upward pressures on oil import prices similarly the president of a multinational nonferrous metal producing firm stated the devaluation had heightened the pressure on raw material prices particularly those of nonferrous metalsagainst this background concern over the prospects of mounting inflationary pressures in general continued unabated the new york banker felt that phase 3 appears to have triggered a new wave of inflationary expectations and stated that inflation was currently the major economic and financial problem facing the nation another director felt that the elimination under phase 3 of the daytoday administrative delays in granting price increases was contributing to the rapid rise in prices and would also contribute to a sharp increase in profits according to most of the buffalo branch directors growing consumer resistance to high food prices by itself would not have a lasting effect however the directors felt that recent moves by the administration to increase the supply of feed grains and imported beef should tend to bring about a leveling of prices by the last quarter of the year
473,474,5-9-1973,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,according to second district directors and other business leaders contacted recently consumer spending continues strong in part stimulated by expectations of higher prices residential construction also remains at a high level on balance although signs of tapering off have emerged shortages of raw materials of energy and of some semifinished and finished products appear to be growing the further recent devaluation of the dollar combined with the previous devaluation in general was expected to bring about an improvement in the countrys international trade balancemost respondents reported continued strength in consumer spending despite increased consumer uncertainties regarding the economic outlook notably a growing concern over inflation it was the consensus of the buffalo branch directors that the deterioration in consumer confidence had in fact been reflected in a rather broad based increase in retail sales which some of the directors viewed as an attempt by consumers to beat anticipated price increases in the case of automobiles the desire to avoid paying for the additional safety and pollutioncontrol devices mandated for 1974 was noted as a factor pushing up current sales the president of a large nationwide chain of retail outlets stated that despite surveys showing a decline in consumer confidence retail sales continue very strong with sales of durable goods leading the way and the president of a chain of department stores in the new york city area similarly reported a good demand for durable goods which he also linked to a desire to avoid paying anticipated higher prices this respondent however felt that in general the pickup in business on the east coast was lagging behind the national performancethe respondents in general continued to find the homebuilding picture strong although a number saw some evidence of a tapering off a rochester banker who reported construction in his area was still booming said that there has been a significant shift from apartment building to condominium and town house construction and that construction of singlefamily residences was proceeding at an active but more selective pace the chairman of the board of a multinational oil corporation and the president of a large nonferrous metalproducing corporation both reported they saw no evidence of a cutback in residential construction a senior official of a large rochester multinational firm however reported some decline in residential building characterizing last years national high housing start rate as not sustainable another director felt that the housing boom gave indication of tapering off in regard to nonresidential construction an upstate banker mentioned the high level of commercial construction that was still related to the rebuilding of businesses destroyed by hurricane agnes last june however a new jersey banker reported a glut of office space in his area while the president of a new york city real estate firm reported that at least 20 million square feet of commercial and industrial building space was currently vacant in the cityas in recent previous months the respondents referred to a growing list of shortages of certain resources the official of the rochester multinational firm stated that raw material shortages were widespread including such items as wood products coal tar derivatives and other products a buffalo manufacturer expressed concern that a period of tight supply was imminent as evidenced by the fact that his firm was being confronted with 20 to 30week lead times for many raw material items a new jersey banker reported inventories of firms in his area to be low with six to eightmonth delivery times for new orders the owner of a large upstate agricultural enterprise mentioned a shortage of protein in all forms which was increasing the cost of feed items for poultry and livestock a number of respondents commented on the petroleum products shortage according to the chairman of the international oil company worldwide supplies of crude oil remain tight and u s production of fuel oil has peaked and is expected to decline the recent relaxing of oil import restrictions should help but lie felt that environmental controls were hindering domestic output similar sentiments were expressed by a senior official of a firm producing a wide variety of petroleum products the president of the nonferrous metals producer noted that power shortages in certain areas were adversely affecting aluminum outputthe dollar devaluation was viewed as likely to improve this countrys international trade position both on the import and export side true the higher dollar costs of oil and nonferrous metal imports were cited as adverse factors the new jersey banker however said that export sales have increased substantiallyalthough he felt it was difficult to estimate the extent of the basic improvement due to price increases and sales to russia and china the buffalo branch directors generally agreed that the exchange rate realignments would have a positive impact on our trade balance one director specifically mentioned that a rochester machine tool firm which exports about 70 percent of its output now expects its overall sales to increase substantially on the import side the president of the large nationwide chain of retail outlets expected the devaluation to slow the growth in the dollar amount of imports of his firm he stated that in terms of cost the balance had now been swung in favor of certain domestic goods for example some types of consumer electronics also a buffalo director felt the devaluations have made it easier for this countrys automobile industry to compete with imported cars he also noted that the domestic shortages noted above in part reflected a switch by many buyers from foreign to domestic sources
485,486,6-13-1973,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the second district directors who were contacted recently generally felt that prices will continue to rise rapidly in the months ahead albeit at a more moderate pace than has been experienced recently a good deal of concern was expressed over the possibility that continued price increases might lead to inflationary wage settlements despite the stability of the overall rate of unemployment the directors have seen increasing evidence of tightness in the labor market especially shortages of skilled labor none of the directors expressed apprehension over the large buildup in consumer credit during the past several months a number of respondents expected the rise to taper off in coming months along with a moderation of the demand for consumer durables the real estate specialists who were contacted expressed mixed opinions on the implications of the proposed changes in the tax treatment of some income from real estate investments but most foresaw little impact on overall construction activityregarding the price picture the directors expected further increases over the coming months but at a more moderate rate the feeling was widely expressed that the sharpness of the recent increases was largely traceable to temporary factors these factors were summed up by the buffalo branch directors as including a broadbased catch up increase in price following the termination of phase ii the recent devaluation of the dollar earlier pressures on industrial production and bad weather conditions for agriculture here and abroad last yearthe continuation of poor weather conditions this year was expected to increase further the cost of foodstuffs to the consumera development felt likely to have a strong impact on union wage demands the chairman of a large new york city bank thus stated that the upsurge in prices will be a significant factor in wage negotiations and could lead to large wage demands this is a major area of uncertainty but if the upsurge in prices is allowed to be translated into large wage settlements next year then the stabilization program will be rendered ineffective this is perhaps the strongest argument for modifying the program and seeking broadbased support similar expectations regarding the possible effects of price increases on wage negotiations were expressed by most other respondentsupward pressures on wages moreover were considered likely to be intensified by conditions in the labor market which as in previous months were generally reported to be tightening special note was taken of shortages of skilled workers including managerial and technical personnelconcerning consumer credit the chairman of the new york bank argued that the nonmortgage debt of households was not out of line historically with consumer incomes similarly none of the buffalo branch directors reported any indication that consumers in their area have been overextending themselves in this regard the president of a buffalo bank mentioned that his assessment was based among other things on an examination of ratios of delinquencies and refinancing to the total amount of consumer credit at his bankthe new york banker attributed the rapid run up in consumer credit to the strong demand for cars appliances and other consumer durables the president of a nationwide chain of retail stores mentioned that the recent sharp rise in this type of credit in good part reflected anticipatory buying related to expected tax refunds and to expected higher prices indeed the desire to avoid higher prices was widely mentioned as a major factor in the high level of consumer spending and the accompanying growth in consumer creditthe president of the retail firm reported that there were now some indications of a slowing in the rate of growth of such credit and the new york banker expected the rate of growth in the sale of consumer durables to slacken significantly over the next year with a concomitant slowdown in the rise of consumer credit while the buffalo branch directors have observed no signs of any weakening of consumer willingness to incur additional debt some noted a growing concern by the public regarding economic conditions that could lead to a slackening in the use of credit later in the yearseveral construction industry specialists at new york banks insurance companies and mortgage firms were queried regarding the possible adverse effects on construction activity of the proposed change in tax legislation mentioned in the st louis bank telegram that would curb the use of some real estate tax shelters one observer forecast a drastic decline in the number of individual investors in the real estate business most respondents however felt that the impact on construction activity of the proposed change was likely to be very limited
497,498,7-11-1973,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,second district directors and other business leaders who were contacted recently were unanimously critical of the price freeze and called for its early termination some had already encountered distortions in their operations owing to the freeze while others had not yet felt any direct impact on their business all however foresaw serious dislocations if the freeze were to continue much longer the sustained buoyancy of retail sales in general continued to be linked to expectations of further price increases no evidence of business inventory buildup was reportedall of the business leaders surveyed in the second district shared the view that the price freeze was likely to lead to serious market distortions the feeling was generally expressed that the temporary freeze should be terminated quickly and that phase iv of the administrations program should be formulated and implemented as rapidly as possible in this connection most of those contacted felt that an early announcement of strong controls was an absolute necessity while some of the directors expressed disappointment that federal fiscal policy had not faced up to its responsibility in the current situation the president of a tire and rubber manufacturing concern expressed the hope that the country is headed for controlled inflation rather than what we are presently experiencing and suggested that the government should provide some indication of its plans if it is going to change the rules of the gameas far as specific problems were concerned discussions with the second district business leaders revealed that serious distortions had already arisen in the agricultural chemical petroleum and some metals industries with domestic prices of a number of items frozen below world market prices the freeze was said to be causing shortages by hampering imports of essential materials and by encouraging sales abroad for example an upstate manufacturer pointed to the difficulties resulting from the continued rise in the cost of imported raw materials which could not be reflected in the prices charged by his company similar experiences were reported by a number of other respondents an upstate banker cited a serious shortage of specialty steel and reported that a number of small machine tool manufacturers in his area were being forced out of business as a direct result of the freeze special concern was expressed over the situation in agriculture where poultry and hog production was being seriously disrupted it was predicted that critical shortages of feedstuffs and fertilizers resulting in part from the freeze might cause food shortages later onregarding consumer spending the directors felt it was still too early to assess the impact of the freeze on consumer attitudes however they saw consumers as willing to pay whatever prices were necessary to purchase goods they currently wanted as in previous months the current high level of retail sales was attributed to expectations of further price increases a buffalo banker however reported that considerable apprehension regarding the future demand for automobiles had been expressed at an economic briefing he had recently attended in detroit to some extent the forecasted decline in demand was attributed to the pollutioncontrol devices mandated for future model yearsregarding business inventory positions the respondents reported seeing no evidence of a buildup at this time partly because of the high cost of financing inventories the upstate manufacturer however reported that while his firm was concerned about low inventories it was having difficulty in strengthening its inventory position because of increased sales
509,510,8-10-1973,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the second district directors and other business leaders who were contacted recently generally expressed doubts regarding the effectiveness of phase iv in bringing about price and wage stability most respondents felt that the dollarfordollar cost passthrough provision would with varying intensity squeeze profit margins several directors reported that so far tightening credit conditions have had little effect on business spending plans of larger firms but some noted it was having a dampening effect on smaller businesses a marked tightening of the mortgage market was also indicateda note of skepticism marked the directors initial assessment of the probable impact of phase iv on the prospects for price and wage stability thus one director characterized this part of the administrations stabilization efforts as a triumph of political expediency over economic reality this view was shared by a number of other directors who also felt that while the new controls might be partially effective as a stop gap measure in achieving price and wage stability growing shortagesnotably of agricultural productswould unavoidably lead to increases in the cost of living and in turn to heightened wage demands the chairman of the board of one of the largest new york city banks stated that an assessment of the impact of the new measure was difficult particularly because of the uncertainties surrounding the implications for wages of a prospective rapid rise in food and certain other prices in this context he felt that at this juncture the longer term outlook for wages and prices seemed closely linked to the extent of the increase in agricultural output and production and its stabilizing influence on the price level generally the president of a large metal producing concern observed that the controls were causing severe domestic shortages of certain internationally traded key materials he felt that the biggest problem associated with phase iv was the 30day prenotification period for price increases applications by large firms which he deemed much too long making it extremely difficult for businesses to respond effectively to changing demand andor cost considerations the president of an upstate bank noted that in contrast to the widespread support accorded phases i and ii small businessmen in his area were not at all pleased with phase iv and that cooperation in the program was not likely to be forthcoming on the other hand an upstate manufacturer assumed there would be tolerance of and adherence to the phase iv program for a reasonable period of timeat least through april 1974and felt that the mandated controls were tough enough to enable a return to a more reasonable and acceptable rate of inflationwith respect to the effect of the dollarfordollar cost passthrough limitation on profit margins it was the consensus of the buffalo branch directors that this proviso would result in some contraction of profit margins in the short run at least as measured on a percent of sales basis the reduction however was not expected to be significant barring a substantial fall in demand the new york banker felt however that this rule could create significant problems for certain firms and reported that his banks research personnel estimated it would reduce aftertax profits by about 2 billionnone of the respondents reported that the dollarfordollar passthrough would have an immediate effect on business spending plans views were mixed however regarding the impact of tightening credit conditions on such plans the new york banker reported that he had not seen widespread evidence that capital spending plans were being deferred as a result of high interest rates and tightening credit conditions although he felt that shortages of equipment and material could have a dampening effect on such outlays a senior official of a large multinational firm said that not only have tightened credit conditions not had an appreciable effect on capital spending but that there was evidence of a spendnow philosophy in the face of inflationary expectations a similar view was expressed by the president of the large metal producing firm while another director reported that executives of large firms with whom he had contacts had suggested to him that capital spending plans were not being materially affected by higher interest rates cash flows were still sufficiently large to finance capital outlays and thus these firms were not especially sensitive to interest rate considerations on the other hand an upstate banker reported that in his area the high levels of interest rates were starting to have a dampening effect on capital spending decisions he reported that among smaller businessmen with whom he had contact borrowing rates in the range of 7 12 percent or higher tended to have an immediate adverse effect on their willingness to commit funds similarly most buffalo branch directors felt tighter credit conditions were bound to have an impact on business spending plans these directors cited instances where bank customers were postponing borrowing and spending plans and reported that banks were rationing available funds by extending credit to their own customers firstthere has been a significant tightening in second district mortgage market conditions according to the opinions expressed by a number of directors and major lenders in that market senior officials of thrift institutions reported that as a result of a net outflow of deposits together with a sizable backlog of unclosed loan commitments little or no funds were available for new mortgages in the 1 to 4family home sector a new jersey savings bank thus reported it was making loans only to depositors with a 40 percent down payment and an official of a large new york savings bank claimed that at this time there was no home mortgage market and that his institution was entering into no new commitments for 1 to 4family homes against this background the respondents felt that the recent increase in the usury ceiling from 75 percent to 8 percent in new york and new jersey effective august 15 in new york would have little or no effect at this time on the home mortgage market officials at the insurance companies commercial banks and mortgage companies who were contacted reported that construction loans and mortgages for commercial propertiesapartments shopping centers office buildingswere available but at very high rates in this context several respondents reported a drop in recent weeks in the demand for such loans which they attributed in part to the high rates and in part to overbuilding in this sector
521,522,9-12-1973,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,second district directors and other business leaders who were contacted recently reported that economic activity remains very brisk but that a number of problems plague businessmen particular concern was expressed over shortages of raw materials rising costs the high level of shortterm interest rates and the uncertainties surrounding the governments economic program little change was reported in labor market conditions with continued reports of shortages of skilled technical and managerial personnel views regarding the outlook for retail sales were mixed but the respondents on balance looked for some tapering in the rate of growth of consumer demand over the coming months consumer resistance to high food prices was not generally expected to have a lasting effect on such pricesconcerning the retail sales outlook the president of a large chain of retail stores anticipated a slowdown in business over the coming months notably with respect to consumer outlays on durable goods the chairman of the board of a large new york city bank also expressed concern over the outlook for retail sales in the fall and winter of this year in his view sales have been stimulated partly by expectations of higher prices he felt that the currently high rate of consumer spending is unsustainable and that the heavy burden of installment indebtedness would lead to some consolidation on the other hand a new jersey banker reported that retailers in his area expected an excellent fall season most of the buffalo branch directors also regarded the sales outlook as good for the rest of the year and well into 1974 but a number of these directors expected a somewhat slower rate of growth in 1974 than in 1973 and looked for weakness developing in big ticket durablesnotably automobiles a senior official of a large multinational firm headquartered in rochester characterized the retail sales outlook as bleak in good part because the increase in food prices will leave consumers with less to spend on nonfood itemsin this connection the respondents in general felt that consumer resistance to high food prices would have little lasting impact on food prices the new york banker noted that consumer boycotts might actually have a perverse impact by discouraging farmers from increasing production he did feel however that shifts in consumption patterns induced by high prices of certain itemssuch as beefmight keep some prices from rising as high as they otherwise might similarly the president of the retail chain felt that consumer resistance to high food prices has had some shortterm effect and that in the future consumers were likely to show a greater tendency to adjust buying habits in response to sizable price movements the buffalo branch directors observed that food had first priority in the consumers budget and that any stabilizing effect on food prices would have to stem more from the supply sidewhere shortages now prevailthan from the demand side in their view food price increases reflect higher production costs and food prices are finally catching up with the rise in other pricesconcerning the employment picture the majority of the respondents saw little change over the past month with scattered exceptions most of the directors noted a continuing shortage of skilled labor the president of a large retail chain thus noted a tightening in the market for various types of positions in the retailing industry and felt that in general competition had increased for managerial and technical personnel in many areas including real estate and the computer field similarly the new york banker reported hearing about shortages of skilled labor in the machinery and textile industry the buffalo branch directors noted the continuation of the tight labor market conditions that lave prevailed for some time in western new york particularly in the machine tool trade and in seasonal farm labor a major exception was the buffalo area which apparently has not been significantly affected by labor shortagesamong the major economic problems foreseen for the balance of 1973 and in 1974 a senior official of a large chemical firm cited the shortage of raw materials and fuel and the disruptions and uncertainties surrounding phase iv as his firms main concern similar sentiments regarding phase iv growing shortages and rising costs were also expressed by several other directors and businessmen the new york banker looked for some decline in economic growth the retailer mentioned slackening consumer demand and rising interest costs as the problems most concerning his firm and several of the bank directors also felt the high cost of money to be one of the major problems from the standpoint of their operations
533,534,10-10-1973,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,most of the second district directors and other business leaders who were contacted recently saw continued strong business demands for materials and goods but looked for some moderating in the pace of overall economic activity in the coming months respondents generally expressed skepticism as to the effectiveness of phase iv in bringing price stability but a number of them were relatively optimistic regarding continued restraint on the part of labor the business inventory picture was mixed with materials generally in tight supply but stocks of finished goods adequate on balance bank respondents felt that the demand for business loans was slackeningmost of the respondents were gloomy regarding the outlook for prices under phase iv a senior official of a large nationwide chemical corporation characterized phase iv as an unqualified economic disaster he felt that the controls might hold some prices down now but at the expense of future increases sharper than would have taken place without such controls the controlsnotably the delays involved in obtaining approval for price increaseswould by limiting profit margins have an adverse effect on business expansion programs aggravating an already serious scarcity situation that exists in a number of areas of the economy moreover in his viewand as a number of respondents had reported in the last few monthshigher prices in the world market than in the domestic market were causing a diversion of sales abroad rather than in this country similar sentiments were expressed by several other industrialists among others the president of a large nationwide fabricator of copper and other metals felt that the situation under phase iv was even worse than under phase iia number of respondents however felt that with some qualifications restraint would continue to be shown in labor wage demands a senior official of a nationwide conglomerate thus reported that recent wage settlements reached with the organizations 50000 workers had involved amounts less than expected and commented on the fine spirit of his workers a director however observed that expectations for moderation in demands for wage increases might be somewhat optimistic because an assumed inflation factor will ultimately be built into wage settlements a number of other respondents also mentioned the rising cost of living notably food prices as a likely factor in forthcoming wage negotiationsnone of the respondents felt that there has been any significant slowing in business demands for materials or manufactured goods in general officials of concerns requiring raw materials stated that their firms were attempting to build up their stocks but were having acute difficulties owing to growing scarcities several of the directors on the other hand saw no evidence of efforts to build up inventories of finished goods an official of a nationwide retail firm reported that his firm was maintaining a cautious inventory policy reflecting expectations of a tapering off of consumer demand over the coming monthsviews were mixed regarding the intensity of the demand for business loans but it was generally agreed that less buoyancy is in prospect most of the directors representing banks and several other officials of large banks who were contacted felt that the demand for business loans was leveling offa few new york city bankers reported that the demand for business loans has continued to exceed expectations but these too anticipate some slackening of demand in the near future to a considerable extent the moderation of demand for bank loans was seen as reflecting a shift of borrowers to the commercial paper market as market rates of interest declined several respondents also felt that a slowing of economic growth in coming months is likely to dampen business loan demands the president of a large upstate bank expressed concern however that declining interest rates might stimulate a resurgence of excessive credit demands
545,546,11-14-1973,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,second district directors and other business leaders who were contacted recently reported that demand pressures remain intense and that materials shortages capacity limitations and delivery delays are continuing to hamper production in many industries the respondents generally felt that current capital spending plans for 1974 would hold up even if the widely forecast slowing in the growth of the economy materializes a moderate increase in the availability of mortgage funds during coming months was expected paralleling an anticipated recovery of deposit flows to thrift institutionsthe respondents generally saw no evidence of any easing in the intensity of demand pressures indeed most felt that the materials shortages capacity pressures and delivery delays were still predominant and in some instances increasing a senior official of a large chemical concern reported that demand pressures in his industry have intensified and that shortages have developed to an extent leading to substantial business slowdowns another director reported that shortages and delivery delays for fuel and raw materials including petrochemical products and steel were expected to slow economic activity in the upstate new york area the president of a large nonferrous metals producer reported that shortages in the copper industry are approaching korean war proportions and that zinc is also in very short supply similar observations were made by senior officials of several other major firms in the metals industry a vice president of a large multinational packaging products firm moreover reported that the shortage of paper was hampering his firms operationsthe only sector where any respondents noted an easing of demand pressures was the consumer sector one director observed that sales of consumer durables both automobiles and home goods appear to be slowing somewhat as a result of heavy purchases over the past year and increasing caution on the part of consumersconcerning prospective business capital outlays all of the respondents who expressed an opinion on the subject felt that current plant and equipment spending plans for 1974 would hold up even if the generally forecast slowdown in the growth rate of the economy materializes most of these respondents felt that owing to the long lead times typically involved in capital spending projects the funds for most 1974 programs have been committed and many of these projects have already been activated some of the business leaders moreover pointed to the need for investment in pollution control equipment to meet governmental standards a number of respondents noted the growing belief on the part of businessmen that current worldwide shortages are likely to persist inducing businesses to increase operating capacity a branch director with farming interests predicted a continuation of high capital spending in the agricultural sector as wellwith respect to prospective developments in the mortgage market over the fall and winter a number of directors felt the availability of funds would meet the demand but at somewhat higher rates larger downpayments and shorter maturities thus an upstate manufacturer felt that while mortgage funds would probably become somewhat more readily available they still would remain relatively scarce because of the higher rate of return available to financial institutions on alternative investments the president of an upstate bank however reported that the recent declines in market rates and the recent increase in the new york state usury ceiling to 812 percent have significantly improved the availability of mortgage funds in his area a new jersey banker however reported that many new jersey institutions appear to be delaying making mortgage commitments awaiting an increase in the states usury ceiling to 812 percent despite the increase in deposits at those institutions resulting from the recent decline in money market ratesin this connection the directors in general felt that the worst of the recent wave of disintermediation is past and that interest rate developments might lead to a reflow of consumer time and savings deposits to banks and thrift institutions in the months ahead the president of an upstate bank stated he expected a material rise in consumertype deposits not only because of rate developments but also because consumers in his area appear to be saving more in anticipation of adverse economic conditions next year another director on the other hand felt that the lower discretionary income levels resulting from relatively moderate wage increases at a time when prices are escalating rapidly is likely to reduce the rate of consumer savings
557,558,12-12-1973,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,second district directors and other business leaders contacted recently expressed considerable concern over the energy crisis shortages of petroleum were viewed as affecting a wide range of industries and as likely to lead to a marked reduction in the growth of economic activity next year and perhaps to a recession for the most part however business capital spending plans were expected to hold up in spite of the energy situation the business inventory picture was mixed but on balance pointed to attempts to increase inventories that may well not succeed because of shortages the respondents expected retailers to enjoy a relatively good holiday season but anticipated a leveling off in sales over the coming monthsthe respondents continued to feel that the shortages and rising costs of petroleum products both as fuel and as raw material were going to have a pronounced adverse effect on virtually all segments of the economy typical of their assessments of the situation was the expectation that supply constraints on output will eventually result in a dropoff in demand owing to growing unemployment and reduced corporate and individual earnings several respondents forecast zero or negative growth in real gnp in 1974 a new york city banker a head office director saw possibilities that the shortages might lead to a significant decline in gnp in his view efforts to curtail industrial and consumer energy consumption might ease the problem but not solve it similar sentiments regarding the overall impact of the energy crisis were expressed by a number of other respondents and senior officials of a wide range of manufacturing as well as retail firms complained of specific problems the petroleum shortage was having on their respective firms several respondents noted that the energy crisis had been building up for some time and would have emerged in the not too distant future even without the arab embargo in good part as a result of insufficient investment by the oil industry in past years in the face of rising worldwide demandagainst this background the buffalo directors generally felt that the governments allocation program did not go far enough and that a system of rationing was needed other respondents variously called for tougher and more clearcut allocation measures that would give priority to the maintenance of industrial and agricultural output and for severe cutbacks in nonessential use efforts to increase domestic fuel supplies were urged but as several respondents noted a fairly long lead time and very large capital investment would be necessary before a significant increase could be expectedregarding business investments those respondents commenting on business capital outlays reported that either their firm or the firms of most of their business contacts intended to implement current plans with no cutbacks one respondent however qualified his remarks by stating that all bets are off because of the energy crisis with respect to inventory policy the retailers stated that they intended to keep their stocks on hand under close scrutiny in view of the expected leveling off in consumer demand other respondents however felt that businessmen were actively attempting to strengthen inventory positions reflecting fears of increasing shortages and higher prices as well as lower than normal inventory positions some felt that existing shortages of both raw materials and finished goods might well frustrate these efforts with only a slight or no increase in inventories several buffalo branch directors however believed many businessmen would find substitute products to meet their requirements and that such shifts in demand might mitigate somewhat the unemployment situation some respondents mentioned the possibility of a rise in inventorytosales ratioseven of involuntary inventory accumulationif the expected decline in business activity materializesconcerning consumer spending senior officials of retail firms who were contacted looked for a fairly good holiday season comparable or somewhat better than last years these expectations were shared by a number of other respondents however the respondents in general were markedly less ebullient than at this time last year moreover most realized that there were clouds ahead for the retail sales industry shortages of goods were expected to become more acute as stocks on hand for the holiday season were drawn down on the demand side tapering off in consumer outlays was expected to accompany the anticipated economic slowdown in addition to the rise in unemployment worries over the economic outlook resistance to high prices and curtailment of automobile use to reach shopping centers were also cited as factors likely to affect sales adversely
569,570,1-16-1974,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,second district directors and other business leaders who were contacted recently in general were somewhat less pessimistic than last month regarding the overall economic impact of the energy crisis the respondents did not expect a cutback in business plans for plant and equipment outlays and in their view consumer spending remains strong at least at this juncture however the respondents did see an actual or prospective increase in unemployment in a number of industries resulting from the petroleum shortage the current weakness in residential construction was attributed primarily to high interest rates and high housing costs rather than to a shortage of mortgage fundsregarding the overall impact of the energy crisis the president of a large petroleum products firm stated his belief that essential industries would get all the oil products required and that any potential gap in supplies would be met by cutbacks in pleasure driving and in other nonessential oil uses in his view the impact on the economy of the oil shortage would turn out to be less severe than had seemed likely initially he felt that current crude oil prices should provide sufficient returns to oil companies to permit them to launch largescale research programs to develop alternative sources of energy he foresaw a sharp increase in gasoline prices however and felt that the allocation of gasoline should not be left in the hands of the man at the gas pump but that mandatory rationing would probably be necessarythe respondents generally felt that the energy situation would not lead to substantial cutbacks in business plans for plant and equipment outlays the buffalo branch directors thus reported that while investment plans were being restudied in light of the energy situation they believed that such plans would not be significantly changed given the current high rate of plant capacity utilization the prospect for continued inflation and the shortages of a growing number of items indeed the directors felt that while the energy situation would affect certain industries more adversely than others they expected that the overall effect of recent economic developments would be to stimulate business plant and equipment spending as examples they cited specific plans of a number of firms for largescale capital outlays and reported that agricultural equipment manufacturers were sold out far in advance and required additional manufacturing facilities several other respondents also indicated that their firms were sticking to their longterm capital investment plans although some saw the possibility that part of some investment programs might have to be deferred because of shortages of materials a senior official of a large chemical corporation reported that owing to the uncertainties associated with the energy crisis capital spending plans were being trimmed in some industrial sectors but that such reductions will have little or no effect on capital outlays over the near term because of the long lead time involved in most capital investment projectsin the view of a number of respondents the current consumer spending picture continues strong the president of a large new york city department store with branches in the suburbs thus reported that his firm had enjoyed a high level of business over the holiday season both in volume and dollar terms and that sales had remained strong after christmas he noted the possibility of scare buying against prospects of rising prices and shortages but stated that he could not determine if this were the case the buffalo branch directors characterized retail sales in western new york during the christmas season as good to excellent strong postchristmas sales were also reported in that area a development which in the view of these directors suggested that there was no hold back in consumer spending at this time the president of a nationwide department store chain however felt that the sale of durable goods had become somewhat softer while an upstate banker reported some reduction in the demand for consumer credit at his bank the retailers in general did not think the gasoline shortage would have much of an adverse effect on their suburban stores most of their customers reside nearby and some expected that women shoppers driving to shopping centers would spend more time at these centers concentrating their purchases at one timethe employment picture was more somber a number of respondents cited actual or prospective layoffs not only in the airline and automobile industries but also in the tourist and related industries as well as in several other key industries particularly those using petrochemicalsnone of the respondents expressing an opinion on the residential construction situation believed the decline in activity in that industry to be traceable to a lack of available mortgage funds at this time rather major deterrents to homebuilding were seen as high interest rates the high and rising cost of land and of new housing shortages of building materials overbuilding in some regions and the termination of certain governmentsponsored housing programs the buffalo branch directors also felt that energy uncertaintiesboth as to heating fuels and as to possible gasoline rationingcould have a potentially serious impact on building in the suburbs
581,582,2-13-1974,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,second district directors and other business leaders who were contacted recently continued to express concern over the potential impact on the economy of the energy crisis the mounting shortages of materials and the persisting strong inflationary pressures the rise in the cost of living was widely expected to result in increasing militancy on the part of labor with little hope for continued moderation in wage settlements the respondents in general felt that the expected decline in economic activity would not have a serious impact on the liquidity or solvency of large firms but that many smaller businesses might be badly hurt responses of officials at mortgage lending institutions suggested that current district construction activity remains in the doldrums but that a significant improvement can be looked for in the second half of the yearopinions varied as to whether the underlying energy situation had changed during the past month or so a number of respondents saw no significant change in its adverse implications for the economy foreseeing a continual gradual deterioration in economic activity among others the president of a nationwide drug manufacturer and a senior official of another leading medical products firm both pointed to difficulties faced by their firms as a result of petrochemical shortages while the chairman of a large new york city bank referred to the steady breakdown effect on the economy of the energy crisis as well as of growing shortages of materials another new york city banker felt that on the basis of talks with his contacts in the oil industry current estimates of the potential increase in us oil production were probably overly optimistic on the other hand the chairman of yet another large new york city bank felt that the oil shortage resulting from the arab embargo would be somewhat less severe than originally anticipated a view shared by several other respondentsconcerning the wage outlook the buffalo branch directors did not report concrete indications of increased militancy on the part of labor in western new york but felt that continued inflation would lead to an increasingly militant stance except for scattered areas and small industries where labor is aware of the threat of unemployment the directors expressed little or no hope for continued moderation in future wage negotiations similar views were expressed by a number of head office directors and senior officials of major nationwide and multinational firms in the same vein the chief economist for a large apparel labor union warned that union leaders could contain union members only so farexpectations were mixed regarding the impact of the anticipated slowdown in economic activity on the liquidity or solvency of business firms the most representative view was that such a decline would not severely affect most large companies particularly those that enjoyed substantial profits in 1973 but that many small and mediumsized businesses were already experiencing cash flow difficulties and that others would be similarly affected in the near termcurrent conditions in second district residential construction generally remained weak according to an informal survey of district mortgage lending institutions the respondents all expected relative softness to persist over the near term but most anticipated a gradual pickup as the year progressed and looked to significant strengthening over the last two quarters among the reasons most frequently mentioned for the current softness were uncertainties regarding the economic outlook on the part of potential home buyers the high cost of homes high interest rates and perhaps more important relatively large downpayment requirementsoverall conditions appear particularly tight in the new york city metropolitan area an official of a large new york city savings bank that operates in the city as well as its suburbs thus noted that while a strong underlying demand for housing was still there in the light of subnormal net inflow of savings deposits his bank has been eliminating many potential borrowers by requiring a 20 percent downpayment on residential housing the shortage of gasoline in the new york area reportedly has discouraged some potential buyers from purchasing homes in the suburbs however some respondents away from the immediate new york metropolitan area painted a somewhat brighter picture with savings banks in fairfield county connecticut long island and upstate new york reporting a slight improvement in recent weeks in net inflows of funds and a concomitant slight increase in their mortgage lending
594,595,3-13-1974,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,second district directors and other business leaders who were recently contacted generally welcomed the phasing out of wage and price controls the respondents continued to see strength in business capital spending apart from automobiles and some other consumer durables retail sales seem to be stronger than expected but some retailers appear to be rather cautious in their sales expectations the recent rise in business inventories does not appear to have resulted from weak salesexcepting largesize automobilesbut rather was attributed primarily to precautionary purchases by businesses against expectations of further price increases and shortagesthe respondents generally indicated that the time had come to eliminate wage and price controls some directors did expect the phasing out of controls to bring about a shortterm spurt in inflation but felt that such a move on balance would have a positive psychological effect on businessmens decisionmaking and that over the longer term market forces would correct supplydemand imbalances the sentiment that controls were contributing to these imbalances was expressed by several other respondents among these the chairman of a large multinational oil corporation noted that while controls had been in effect for over two and one half years they had failed to bring inflation under control but had created uncertainties and contributed to shortages of various products he felt that their removal would improve the business climate and probably help avoid a serious contraction in business activitythe respondents in general expected the sizable planned increase for 1974 in business plant and equipment outlays to be largely implemented a new york city banker thus noted that many industries will continue to operate close to capacity even during a mild recession and will require additional capacity to meet demand in the next period of expansion the view that capacity shortages would stimulate capital investments was also expressed by the chairman of a large oil corporation who noted that petroleum industry capital spending was expected to rise sharply to help meet the countrys energy need an upstate banker similarly looked for increased demand for energyrelated capital equipment while another upstate banker felt that the current shift toward smaller cars in the automobile industry would require major plant and equipment expenditures the president of a large nationwide retail chain felt that recent economic developments should have no significant impact on business spending plans he noted that in the retail industry and presumably many other industries capital spending decisions are made far in advance of actual outlays leaving little flexibility to respond to changes in the shortterm economic outlook some respondents however while in general expecting continued strength in capital outlays did express some reservations regarding businessmens ability to implement fully their plans because of materials shortagesconcerning consumer spending the president of the retail chain mentioned above reported that his firms sales in february had slightly exceeded expectations in both store and catalog operations but that the firm was maintaining a cautious attitude over the sales outlook because of the potential problems facing the economy over the next several months a new york city banker while characterizing retail sales as fairly good pointed to the decline in auto sales and to signs of slippage in appliance and lowerpriced furniture sales one observer noted however that appliance sales have been exceeding some manufacturers expectations the chairman of a drug manufacturing firm moreover felt the retail sales picture remained strong while another respondent reported that his contacts at a large new york city department store characterized business as boominga number of respondents reported some changes in consumers buying habits the buffalo branch directors felt that on the one hand inflation was promoting anticipatory buying but that at the same time consumers were constrained by the fact that prices were rising faster than incomes one director pointed to increased emphasis on utilitarian purchases and decreased emphasis on frill items on the other hand the chairman of a major nationwide food processing firm reported a surprising upgrading of quality in consumers purchases a retailer reported that owing to the gasoline shortage consumers seem to be concentrating their grocery clothes dry cleaning and most other shopping at one timemainly on saturdaysin the view of most respondents largesize automobiles were about the only sector where weak sales seem to have accounted for the recent buildup in inventories most felt that inflation and fear of scarcities were important factors in the recent increase an upstate banker reported that inventory financing at his bank was at an all time high and saw evidence that some businesses were buying whatever they could now in anticipation of more serious future shortages a new york banker also mentioned evidence of growing speculative inventory building because of fears of further price increases or of continued shortages he and several other respondents however reported that businessmen in general felt their inventory positions to be in reasonable balance with sales except for shortages of a number of materials in this context it was noted that in some instances shortages of certain items prevented some firms from converting a substantial part of their present inventories into marketable products
606,607,4-10-1974,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,second district directors retailers and new york city bankers who were contacted recently painted a generally more optimistic picture of the current economic outlook as compared to last month a number of respondents characterized business conditions as stronger than expected to very strong and booming the respondents in general felt the end of the arab oil embargo would provide some if only moderate nearterm boost to economic activity the retailers and other respondents on balance reported more strength in consumer spending than had been expected earlier the sharp rise in recent weeks in business loans was traced primarily to inventory building by business firms as a hedge against expected price increases and scarcities as well as to a shift from the commercial paper marketthe respondents on balance felt the lifting of the oil embargo would provide some nearterm stimulus to economic activity in particular the end of the embargo was expected to bring relief to those sectors that have been most adversely affected by the oil shortage and at least removed the threat of the more serious consequences that might have occurred if the embargo had been maintained for a longer period a number of respondents however noted that the severe shortages of productive capacity and of numerous materials remained a serious cause for concernseveral respondents felt that the lifting of the embargo would have some positive influence on consumer attitudes and indeed as noted above a fairly strong retail sales picture emerged from the observations of the retailers and other respondents thus the buffalo branch directors reported retail sales in their areas to be at least at and perhaps somewhat above earlier forecasts the president of a buffalo department store reported sales at his store had been running somewhat above last year and a senior official of a large multinational firm based in rochester mentioned a strong demand for firms products as did another upstate manufactureramong the retailers who were contacted the chairman of a new york city area middleprice department store chain stated that primarily as a result of promotional efforts sales at his stores in the recent past had exceeded by a considerable amount the levels forecast earlier in the year moreover on the basis of conversations with officials of other retail firms he believed that similar department stores in the new york metropolitan area were having comparable experiences a senior official of a highquality new york city department store with branches in the suburbs did characterize the current retail sales picture as soft but expected that for 1974 as a whole business at his firm would be somewhat higher than in 1973 in physical volume as well as in dollar terms an official of a nationwide department store chain reported that his firms sales had increased somewhat more than expected and noted that while the rate of increase has been below that of the comparable period last year his firm had enjoyed an extremely strong first quarter in 1973regarding the current large demands for shortterm bank credit by business firms the directors and the new york city bankers who were contacted generally attributed the sharp rise in such credit primarily to inventory building this accumulation in turn was variously attributed to fears of shortages to expectations of price increases and to the higher cost of carrying inventories as a result of the previous increases in prices some respondents also felt the rise to be related to some extent to taxborrowing another major factor cited by the new york city bankers has been a shift from the commercial paper market to commercial bank credit induced by the rise in money market rates the effect of this shift according to one bank economist may have been largely concentrated in the new york credit market
618,619,5-15-1974,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,second district directors and other business leaders who were contacted recently on the whole felt that the recent slowdown in business activity would be followed by some improvement in the latter part of the year although some expressed doubts about this prognosis the respondents generally expected further significant price increases consumer outlays remained relatively strong in the new york city area but some weakening was noted upstate construction is expected to be further adversely affected by the rise in shortterm interest rates and the resulting outflow of funds from thrift institutions views regarding the prospective demand for shortterm business credit were mixed but on balance pointed to a sustained strong demandthe directors in general agreed that the slackening in business activity which has occurred in recent months is likely to be followed by an improvement as the year wears on the president of a large chemical corporation thus characterized the slack in the economy as minor and the president of a large nationwide retail concern looked for some improvement in the second half of the year the president of a multinational nonferrous metal concern expected a moderate increase in real gnp for the year as a whole another director reported strength in the airline semiconductor and media industries an upstate banker expected continued strong demand for goods and services and expressed the view that if inflation can be controlled the economy would look much better by the end of 1974 or early 1975 several respondents however stressed the uncertainty surrounding the prospects for the recoveryamong the businessmen who were contacted prior to the termination of remaining price controls on april 30 most anticipated a further surge in pricesled by copper steel and other raw materialsfollowing the already large increases which had occurred during the progressive relaxation of controls others expected no explosive surge in prices as a result of the full elimination of price controls but did look for large selective increases in previously controlled areas and more moderate increases elsewhere the buffalo branch directors contacted during the past week anticipated a continuation of upward pressures on prices and wages principally as a result of catchup price increases for those industries where price controls had created distortions and where wage and salary increases were needed to make up for increases in the cost of living that had already occurredconcerning consumer spending a senior official of an upstate department store reported some softening in retail sales in western new york however as noted above an upstate banker saw a continued strong demand for goods and services moreover a recent survey by a local newspaper of major new york city department stores with branches in the suburbs revealed that april retail sales in the new york metropolitan area had been significantly higher than in april 1973 both in real and in dollar terms and that most bigstore executives had become more optimistic regarding the retail sales outlookperhaps the weakest spot in the districts current economic picture is found in the construction industry the respondents expressing an opinion on this subject generally expected the rise in shortterm interest rates to have a serious adverse effect on residential construction the cost of new housing and the shortage of building materials continued to be cited as adverse factors however according to several local savings banks the major adverse factor has now become the unavailability of funds as a result of severe outflows of funds from thrift institutions to higher yielding money market instrumentsnotably shortterm treasury securities as a result thrift institutions have substantially tightened their already tight lending terms and have become very selective in making new commitmentsviews were mixed regarding the outlook for demands for shortterm credit by businesses a number of observers attributed the very strong credit demands of recent months primarily to inventory accumulation as a hedge against inflation and shortages some felt that such demand will taper off the majority of the respondents however expected continued strong demands for shortterm credit among those respondents the president of a large chemical firm thus anticipated a continued strong demand for credit stemming from the impact of inflationary pressures on business working capital needs and another director felt the same factor would sustain credit demands in the agricultural sector the president of a large nonferrous metal producer stated that one factor contributing to the demand stemmed from the financing requirements related to the extended delays on major industrial construction projects another director noted that the high rates in the longterm capital markets were inducing firms to draw upon their bank lines of credit the need to finance rising accounts receivables was also cited as a factor likely to sustain credit demand there were also reports that purchasers of commercial paper have been upgrading their portfolios with the result that firms whose credit ratings fall short of the highest rank have found it increasingly difficult to sell commercial paper
631,632,6-12-1974,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,according to second district directors and other business leaders who were recently contacted there has as yet been little easing of materials shortages and capacity limitations the business capital spending outlook on balance remains strong but the district residential construction picture appears bleak high financing costs as well as shortages may be inhibiting inventory investment in some sectors and little evidence of excessive inventory accumulation was notedmost respondents perceived little or no indications that shortages and capacity limitations were easing up among others the president of a multinational chemical corporation reported continuous shortages and capacity limitations in his industry while a senior official of a nationwide chain of department stores noted that many items were still not available an official of a large paper firm reported that while his firm might be obtaining an adequate supply of raw materials the production capacity situation in the paper industry was still very tight and his firm was behind in shipping its products to its customers the president of a large electrical equipment distributing firm on the basis of conversations with his firms suppliers saw no easing as yet in the supply and capacity picture on the other hand the chairman of a large new york city bank reported that some basic materials have become more easily available since price controls were removed and the president of a nonferrous metals product manufacturing concern reported some softening in the copper and brass markets which he associated with the current weakness in the auto and construction industries both respondents however noted that many materials shortages still persistresponses to a question about business capital spending were mixed but most of the respondents felt that financial market conditions had not yet caused firms to cancel or cut back their capital spending plans at least in dollar amounts the new york city banker mentioned above thus stated that he was not aware of any reduced capital spending plans while the retailer reported that his firm was upgrading its capital spending plans to take into consideration the rise in construction costs the official of the paper firm reported that his firm and probably the paper industry in general was embarking on a three to fiveyear expansion program involving significantly higher outlays than had been expected in recent years while the president of a diversified financial institution characterized the demand for capital as still good on the other hand the president of a large new york city bank stated that some of his banks business customers reported that their firms were cutting their expansion programs in physical terms although not in dollar terms and the chairman of another large new yorkbased financial institution noted some cooling of enthusiasm regarding expansion programs the president of the nonferrous metal products concern stated that his firms had become definitely more conservative with respect to capital expenditures in the light of current financial market conditions and while another director was not aware of reduced capital spending plans solely as a result of financial market conditions he felt this could become a factor for some electric utilitiesthere were suggestions that current high shortterm interest rates may be as stated by a new york city banker acting as a restraining influence on firms inventory policies the president of the nonferrous metal products firm reported that the high cost of carrying inventories had induced his firm to institute tighter inventory controls the great majority of the respondents commenting on the inventory situation felt that there has been no excessive inventory accumulation as yet among others the president of an electric equipment distributing firm reported that his firms sales had risen more rapidly than its inventories and he felt this was also true for many of its customers other respondents including the retailer and the paper company official cited the shortage of some items as another factor inhibiting inventory accumulationsecond district residential construction remains weak the president of a large new york city savings bank cited the continued loss of deposits by thrift institutions to higheryielding treasury securities and in his view even more significant the high cost of construction with new housing not selling well an official of a savings bank trade association reported that savings banks in the new york city area had continued to suffer net outflows of deposits in may and that the savings and loan associations had probably undergone a similar experience he saw no evidence of a turnaround in residential construction at this moment the respondents in general felt that the administrations new housing program was likely to have little effect on the housing industry in the view of the savings bank association official it might be a cushion to a further decline in residential construction rather than a stimulus
643,644,7-10-1974,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,second district directors and other business leaders who were recently contacted generally foresaw some moderation of inflation particularly among basic commodities however some expected prices of finished goods to continue under strong upward pressure as earlier increases in raw material costs are passed on it was generally agreed moreover that increased militancy on the part of labor will intensify costpush pressures on prices the respondents observed no evidence of a lessening of pressure on productive capacity during the past month some concern was expressed over the mood of uneasiness pervading the business community concerning the liquidity of both financial and nonfinancial firms it was generally agreed that the overall liquidity situation had not reached crisis proportions but some observers felt that serious trouble may lie aheadwhile most respondents expected inflation to moderate somewhat the degree of relief which was expected varied a number of directors reported they did not anticipate further excessive price boosts and looked for some decline in food prices moreover the respondents in general expected the recent softening in some commodity prices to continue the chairman of a large textile concern thus reported that prices of cellulose fiber had stopped rising and that he expected some decline in these prices a senior official of a large multinational concern based upstate expressed the opinion that prices in international markets of certain raw materials and agricultural products would continue to decline with the tapering off of demand in many countries similar sentiments were expressed by other respondentson the other hand there were no reports of any easing of pressures on productive capacity indeed among the comments obtained the chairman of a large chemical firm felt there would be no such easing in the chemical industry for four or five years similarly the chairman of another large chemical corporation stated that chemical companies must continue expanding to keep up with demand both of these respondents commented on the high cost of construction one reported his firm was paying 50 percent more for plant construction than three years ago and the other characterized such costs as unbelievablethe respondents in general expected increased militancy on the part of labor to secure catchup wage increases some of the respondents notably the two chemical officials mentioned above looked for wages to go up at a considerable rate similarly the upstate industrialist felt labor pressure would be intense and that wagepush pressure on prices would prevent the rate of inflation from declining significantly for several years most buffalo branch directors on the other hand felt that while wagepush pressures are to be expected they might not cause prices to rise sharplyregarding liquidity positions the buffalo branch directors expressed concern over the strains on the liquidity of both financial and nonfinancial firms the present situation is felt to be especially difficult for banks in view of the publicity surrounding the financial troubles of franklin national bank the president of a large buffalo bank expressed concern over the emergence of twotier markets for eurodollars and large cds where the money center banks could still raise funds but where regional banks had more difficulties in doing so and had to pay higher rates the chairman of a new jersey bank pointed to the fairly serious problems confronting many real estate investment trusts while the chairman of a textile firm stated he feared that the smaller companies in his industry were also experiencing serious liquidity problems it was generally agreed that the liquidity situation had not yet reached the crisis state although some observers felt somewhat apprehensive about the future
655,656,8-14-1974,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,in the views of the second district directors and other business leaders who were contacted recently while many firms are critically reexamining their capital spending plans few are cutting back such plans with the notable exception of utilities the majority of the respondents similarly felt that no major attempts to reduce inventories had got underway as yet at the same time however the comments of several respondents indicated that somewhat more cautious inventory policies might be emerging some observers expected the 1974 model automobiles to sell out quickly but expressed apprehensions about the outlook for demand for the 1975 models views were mixed regarding the prospective strength of business loan demand but there was general agreement that bank lending policies had become tighterregarding business plant and equipment outlays the buffalo branch directors felt that despite currently tight conditions in the financial market most corporations were going forward with their capital spending plans prompted by shortages in productive capacity and by the need to improve productivity among other respondents a senior official of a new york city securities firm reported that except for utilities and some other scattered instances he could not discern cutbacks in corporations longer term capital investment plans a view that was expressed by several other respondents and while a new jersey banker felt that a continued high level of interest rates might eventually lead to some retrenchment in business capital outlays he had seen little of that so far in his areasimilarly most of the respondents had observed no major efforts as yet to reduce inventories the official of the securities firm stated that notwithstanding the high level of interest rates the current rate of inflation still made it profitable to accumulate inventories several respondents attributed the high level of inventories to the rapid inflation and the frequently long delivery leadtimes which encouraged businessmen to increase stocks on hand both as a hedge against further price increases and as protection against shortages on the other hand a senior official of a nationwide department store chain attributed the recent buildup in that firms stocks to a shortening of some suppliers delivery leadtimes a senior economist at a large new york city bank reported that whereas until recently the banks corporate clients had been using credit to invest in inventories the rise in interest rates combined with the fact that the prices of many commodities were no longer rising as rapidly as previously had made the carrying of excessive inventories too costly and that this had been reflected in some slowdown in the rate of accumulation similarly a senior official of a large upstate new york firm stated that in view of the rise in interest rates and the decline in price of some commodities carrying excess inventories had become riskyregarding consumer spending the department store chain official reported that his firms sales had been better than expected during the first half of the year he expected a good second half although the rate of increase would probably be slower an upstate retailer expected an increase in dollar sales over last years level but somewhat lower physical volume another director saw the retail sales picture as being fairly flat the new jersey banker expected that retail salesparticularly of automobiles and other bigticket itemswould be adversely affected by inflation in this connection an upstate banker reported a sharp reduction at his bank in consumer loans for appliance purchases although demand for home improvement loans remains heavy several respondents felt the shortrun outlook for automobile sales was better today than a few months ago and expected a rather quick sellout of remaining 1974 models they did note however that the longterm outlook for auto sales was clouded by concern over public acceptance of 1975 models equipped with largely unproven catalytic converters and by the uncertainties regarding the availability of the leadfree gasoline required to fuel models equipped with
656,657,8-14-1974,New York,such anti-pollution devices.,with respect to the demand for business loans the new jersey banker the securities concern official and several other respondents saw no letup at this time on the other hand several upstate bankers felt that such demand had probably peaked at least for the balance of the year in part as a result of sluggish economic conditions similarly a senior economist at a major new york city bank reported that business loan demand at his bank while still high was tapering offthe respondents in general reported a tightening in banks lending policies among others the new jersey banker stated that his bank had adopted a hard nosed lending policy it was making no new commitments and extending only modest amounts to regular customers similarly the new york bank economist reported that his firm had not taken on new corporate customers for some time and was discouraging its regular customers from borrowing for nonproductive purposes such as accumulation of excess inventories and the acquisition of other firms
668,669,9-5-1974,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,second district directors and other business leaders who were contacted recently in general felt that the recent change in the administration would have a favorable if only mild effect on the business outlook the respondents however were less than sanguine regarding the probable effectiveness of the council on wage and price stability in curbing inflation there were reports of easing shortages in a number of lines alongside continued tight supply conditions in other lines excessive inventories were reported to be becoming a problem for some firms especially in the retail field the residential construction picture in the district remains bleakthe respondents in general looked for little immediate change in the fundamental economic outlook as a result of the recent change in administrations the reaction however on the whole was favorable for example a senior official of a large upstate hank felt that the government would now be able to give fuller attention to economic problems similarly the president of a large nationwide department store chain noted that the new president had already indicated that economic problems would receive his prompt attention and that the present cooperative atmosphere between the administration and the congress could lead to substantial progress as far as the business outlook is concerned in his view the presidents decision to call the economic summit conference was a positive first stepmost respondents expressing a view on the subject however felt that the new council on wage and price stability would be relatively ineffective in holding down inflation the respondents in general were opposed to the reimposition of wage and price controls in this context the president of a multinational firm expressed the belief that firm guidelines for wages and prices tend to become floors and interfere with the proper operation of the economyviews were mixed regarding the impact on current pricing policies of fears of a return to jawboning or price controls but the majority of the respondents expressed the view that such fears were not a major factor in firms pricing decisions most of the buffalo branch directors thus felt that competition prevented such practices similarly the president of a large retail chain reported that his firms pricing decisions were only based on traditional considerations such as costs and the competitive environment and the president of a nonferrous metal concern stated that pricing behavior in the metals industry reflected supply and demand conditions and not fears of a return to jawboning or price controls the senior official of a large upstate manufacturing firm however thought that fears of price controls had influenced businessmen who wanted to get ahead of the game before controls were reinstated and a similar view was expressed by a new jersey bankerregarding shortages of materials there were a number of reports of easing in certain lines but of a continuing tight supply picture in others the retailer mentioned above thus reported signs of an easing in several areas of his firms business notably textiles most of the buffalo branch directors reported some easing of shortages as did a number of other respondents a senior official of a multinational petroleum concern reported that petroleum was no longer in short supply but that a possible coal strike this fall could increase oil demand he also reported a shortage of drilling equipment other respondents mentioned continued shortages of chemicals steel alcohol paper boxes and certain replacement partsregarding the inventory picture the respondents on balance felt that the buildup of inventories has begun to become a problem in some lines among others the president of the large department store chain mentioned above reported that inventories were building up at the retail level as well as at the wholesale level and in some instances such as bigticket appliances at the manufacturing level an upstate retailer also stated that high inventories have become a problem in the retail line the president of a nonferrous metal firm noted that while stocks of metals are still very low inventories of some metal products are building up another observer indicated that stockpiling of raw materials and workinprocess items had been attractive when expected cost increases were much greater than carrying costs but that the situation was now reversingresidential construction in the district particularly in the new york city metropolitan area remains very weak thrift institutions have suffered a massive outflow of funds and in many cases are granting no new mortgage commitments or are requiring large downpayments and other stiff terms one large new york city savings bank for example is granting mortgage loans only to depositors of two years standing requiring that at least 5000 be maintained in the account from the time the application is received to the closing of the loan and stipulating that the rate be renegotiated every five years
680,681,10-9-1974,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,second district directors and other business leaders who were contacted recently on balance felt that retail sales were holding up better than had been expected there continued to be reports of easing shortages in a number of lines along with persisting tight supply conditions in others the respondents did not think that firms were raising prices because of apprehension of a return to price controls no significant easing of liquidity pressures was notedregarding consumer spending the buffalo directors generally characterized retail sales other than automobiles as being stronger than had been expected a sentiment shared by an official of a nationwide chain of department stores an upstate businessman a director felt that although the higher price for 1975 automobile models might have an initial adverse impact on auto sales if the new models appealed to the public such sales would return to normal in this context a new york city representative of a major auto manufacturer stated that while only a few days had elapsed since his firms new models had been introduced dealers were reporting a very favorable public reaction to the design and engineering improvements in the firms 1975 modelson a more restrained line a number of the respondents indicated that although retail sales levels appear to remain high consumers are bargain hunting to a greater degree than before and a senior official of a high quality new york city department store with branches in the suburbs reported that his firm had taken a gloomy view early in the year but had been pleasantly surprised until september since then his firms business had turned soft particularly with respect to durable goods and big ticket itemsconcerning supply conditions the president of a multinational chemical firm reported some easing in certain lines of chemicals and in packaging products while the chairman of a major oil company characterized the supply picture in the petroleum industry as quite strong with substantially higher inventories of fuel and heating oil the president of an upstate bank stated that supply conditions in general had eased somewhat a sentiment expressed by several other respondents the retailers that were contacted reported some easing in textile products and another observer reported a greater availability of certain lumber products the buffalo directors however stated that supply conditions remained tight for critical items used in manufacturing such as stainless steel zinc paper products metal casing and welding rods and noted that in general delivery times for manufactured goods were much longer than last year a director closely associated with new york state agriculture reported that fertilizer and box material remained in tight supply and that rapidly rising prices as yet had not dampened the demand for these productsrespondents expressing an opinion on the price situation did not think that firms were raising prices because of fears of a return to price controls rather the rapid increase in prices was attributed to higher operating costs and declining profit margins a senior official of a large multinational firm based upstate stated that business generally recognized that if price controls were reinstated such a move might well be accompanied by mandatory price rollbackscomments regarding the unemployment situation were received before the release of the september unemployment figures at that time the respondents attributed the continued relatively strong employment picture in the face of weakness in some other economic indicators primarily to the limited extent of the decline in industrial production and to the strong corporate profit picture which has induced less layoffsviews regarding the impact on liquidity positions of the recent decline in shortterm rates were best summed up by the buffalo directors no significant easing of liquidity pressures was noted by these directors they generally felt that current shortterm rates could be tolerated by large industries but that liquidity pressures continue to be particularly intense for the small businessman moreover while shortterm rates may have gone down there has been little change inlongterm rates posing problems with respect to longterm financing for industry and municipalities
692,693,11-13-1974,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,second district directors and other business leaders who were contacted recently in general reported that they were taking a dimmer view of the economic outlook than last month and did not expect a pickup in business activity until mid1975 the retail sales picture continues sluggish particularly with respect to auto sales construction remains in the doldrums with little improvement expected over the next six months the district unemployment rate has been running at about the national level but substantially higher in new york city there were scattered reports of a lessening of upward pressure on prices and of actual declines in some materials pricesmost of the respondents reported that their outlook for the economy had worsened over the past month among others the buffalo branch directors expressed the feeling that the current slowdown in business activity was likely to be more pronounced and of longer duration than had been previously anticipated the president of a large chemical concern stated that he believed the outlook for the economy was for a general weakening amidst a feeling of gloom and the chairman of a large new york city bank reported that his estimates of the strength of the economy had moved lower over the past month and felt that inventory liquidation would have a depressing effect the president of a multinational nonferrous metal producer expected the economy to remain flat until the middle of next year when a slower upturn would occur similar sentiments were expressed by a number of other respondentsthe district retail sales picture continues sluggish a number of respondents felt that new automobile sales would be at least 5 percent lower in 1975 than in 1974 and that the demand for other durable goods had also weakened these respondents felt that while the demand for nondurable goods might be stronger the overall retail sales picture was not likely to show significant improvement over the next six months against this background retailers have been intensifying their promotional efforts with increased advertisements and special sales the extent of the success of these efforts however remains to be seenregarding residential construction the majority of the respondents felt that the recent drop in interest rates would have no significant impact on housing starts over the next few months while several respondents felt that rates would have to move significantly lower before residential construction picked up the buffalo directors although feeling that the decline in housing starts appears to have bottomed out cited the higher cost of construction as a major deterrent to an upturn in construction activity in the immediate future the new york city banker mentioned above stated that an oversupply in housing was an even more important factor than the high level of interest rates in inhibiting construction activity a senior official of a new york city based thrift institution association reported that following a further sizable outflow of funds from district mutual savings banks in september such outflow appears to have tapered off in october for the time being however he felt that any possible increase in deposits at these institutions would first be reflected in repayments of loans from commercial banks rather than in new mortgage commitmentsunemployment in new york state as a whole has been running at about the same level as nationwide however the jobless rate for new york city has been substantially higher amounting to 74 percent in septembera number of respondents reported that as a result of the sluggish economy wholesale prices for a number of raw materials have dropped and that lead times for orders of many items have been shortened these respondents expected that this will result in some reduction in finished product prices as well as in the liquidation of inventories built up in anticipation of increased shortages and rising prices so far however there appears to be little evidence of discounting from list prices although there are indications of a shift toward a buyers market for a number of products with future price concessions a real possibility
704,705,12-11-1974,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the views expressed by second district directors and other business leaders who were contacted recently in general reflected the nationwide slowdown in business activity department store sales have been relatively sluggish for this time of year business inventory policies have become significantly more cautious with some instances of outright liquidation reported shortages of goods and materials have reportedly eased substantially despite the rise in overall unemployment however shortages of skilled workers persistregarding consumer spending the buffalo branch directors on balance felt that the sharp decline in auto sales had not been paralleled in their area by a similar fall in the sale of other major consumer items nevertheless these directors generally agreed that retail sales of nonautomotive durable goods had weakened among other respondents the president of a high quality new york city department store reported that his firms sales had declined in november which is usually a good month and while he expected some improvement in december he looked for christmas sales to be only a little better than last year in dollar terms similar sentiments were expressed by a senior official of a large new york city department store with branches in the suburbs who also expressed concern over the retail sales outlook over the coming months similarly a survey of new york city department stores by a local newspaper revealed that november sales at many of these stores had undergone their worst yeartoyear decline in four years business however has apparently picked up with the advent of the christmas season with observers reporting heavy crowds and good business as noted by several respondents however it appears to be a bargain hunters market with heavy promotion and with many stores holding at this time the usual postchristmas clearance sales of both soft and hard goods similarly many supermarkets have been holding special sales and running advertisements offering discount coupons for selected itemsagainst the background of relatively weak consumer demand there were indications of a reevaluation of inventory policies the buffalo branch directors thus agreed that both retail and manufacturing firms have been attempting to adjust inventory positions downward not only because of the weak retail sales picture but also because of the easing of commodity prices and the high cost of financing inventories the senior official of a large buffalo department store reported that his firm had reduced its onhand inventory and future commitments of apparel about 20 per cent below last years level a move he felt was not unusual for the retail trade industry similarly the two new york city retailers mentioned above reported that their firms were attempting to maintain a lean inventory position a senior official of a nationwide metal processing firm reported his firm was no longer able to sell all it produced a development he felt indicated that the firms customers were drawing down on their existing inventories the chairman of a conglomerate stated his firm was liquidating inventories and would continue to do so it was noted however that while inventories might be too high in some sectors a number of items such as heavy machinery electrical equipment and metal casing still required long order lead timesdistrict construction activity particularly in the new york city area remains at a low ebb although the outlook has brightened somewhat over the past month a survey by a trade association indicates that new york state savings banks experienced moderate net deposits inflows in november following seven consecutive months of net outflows several thrift institution officials in new york have suggested however that these funds would not flow immediately into the mortgage market but would be used initially to rebuild liquidity positionsthe nationwide advance in the unemployment rate was reflected in the reports of several respondents thus the two new york city retailers mentioned above stated their firms were attempting to trim personnel as well as other costs and the chairman of the conglomerate reported his firm was cutting down its sales force the buffalo directors however felt that with the exception of layoffs in the automotive industry employment in general appeared to be holding up well in the upstate new york region and that the supply of skilled labor remained tight in their views there appeared to be no evidence as yet of major layoffs of managerial and professional employees the directors were however concerned that if the economy continues to decline layoffs in the managerial and professional ranks may well occur
717,718,1-15-1975,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,views expressed by second district directors retailers and other business leaders who were contacted recently point to a further slowing in business activity over the past month retail sales in general have been sluggish although strengthening somewhat recently inventories are at or approaching excessive levels and unemployment is on the rise at the same time there has been no lessening of liquidity pressuresretail sales over the holiday season were on the weak side but in many cases no worse than the relatively pessimistic expectations a survey of the seven leading new york city department stores by a local newspaper revealed that in dollar terms december sales by these stores within the city had been slightly below those of december of 1973 implying a significant decline in physical volume sales of major appliances and other durable goods in general were particularly weak dollar sales at those stores suburban branches however were slightly above last years the president of a large rochester department store reported sales by his firm to be in line with his expectations that they would run at about the same level as a year ago in dollar terms similarly a senior official of a large department store chain reported that dollar sales at the firms western new york affiliates in november and december were about equal to those of the year earlier period but that physical volume was about 4 percent lower than during novemberdecember 1973the retail sales picture appears to have brightened somewhat in recent weeks however in response to both prechristmas and the usual postholiday sales thus the president of a nationwide retail firm stated that business during most of the christmas buying season ran significantly below expectations but that as a result of heavy promotional activities the season had ended on a strong note with good traffic continuing after christmas a senior official of a large new york city department store similarly reported that after a slow start business had been brisk in the final days of the holiday season a development also reported by several other retailers among others the president of another large new york department store with branches in the suburbs stated that christmas sales had been up to his expectations and that so far his firms january sales had been producing business and were heavier than in january 1973in the view of several respondents the reduction in consumer demand and the accompanying more competitive selling practices have been reflected in some evidence of downward pressures on prices of finished goods one retailer stated that price reductions for various items were legion within the retail industry generally due to overproduction by manufacturers of dry goods appliances and similar items and to the desire to reduce inventories the respondents however did not regard the decline in a number of raw material prices as having as yet had a significant influence on the price of finished goodsregarding inventory positions the president of the nationwide retail firm mentioned above reported that his firm had been overstocked for several months and was making major efforts to get its inventories into line with consumer demand a senior official of a multinational chemical concern stated that while inventories had not yet built to excessive levels he expected increases during the first half of 1975 the chairman of a large new york city bank looked for inventories to rise sharply in response to falling sales several other respondents however felt that inventories remained at an acceptable levelthe district unemployment situation deteriorated further during the past month particularly in the new york city area and in buffalo the november jobless rate in new york state rose to 66 percent and to 74 percent in new york city december figures are expected to show a substantial further rise there have been frequent reports of layoffs by major firms in various parts of the district and in recent weeks new claims for unemployment insurance benefits in new york state have been among the highest in the nation however the majority of the respondents commenting on the subject as yet discerned little or no easing of the shortage of skilled workers or of highly qualified managerial employees some respondents however did see or expected to see shortly some easing in the situationregarding liquidity positions none of the respondents reported any signs of easing in pressures thus far on the contrary the majority of the buffalo directors felt that conditions were worsening several of these directors noted that in view of the unattractiveness of the bond and equity markets and the lack of access to national money markets generally many businesses in their area were seeking commercial bank loans for working capital or to at least temporarily finance capital expansion others cited the substantial increase in delinquencies on accounts receivables and the increase in the number of bankruptcies
729,730,2-12-1975,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the picture that emerges from the views expressed by second district directors and other business leaders who were contacted recently is one of further declines in economic activity consumer demand has been generally sluggish although aggressive sales promotions and cutbacks in purchases from suppliers have enabled some merchants to reduce inventories business capital spending plans are being scaled down unemployment is rising rapidly but most respondents have observed little or no moderation in wage demands they did note however some indications of a slowing of the rate of price increasesconcerning consumer spending district retail sales appear to have been running below the nationwide average with the new york city retail sales picture showing particular weakness an official of a trade association thus reported that business at the citys department stores was about 4 percent lower in dollar terms this january than in january 1974 he stated that traffic at the major stores was down significantly and that there seems to be considerably less impulse buying similarly an executive of a high quality new york city department store with branches in the suburbs reported that sales by his firm have been running behind last year in real terms and have been struggling along to maintain the same level in dollar terms he noted however that business was somewhat better at the firms suburban branches some new york city retail merchants did report that sales and promotions have been fairly successful in attracting business these sales have covered a much wider range of merchandise than usual including goods that normally would not be placed on sale until spring and have involved significantly greater price concessions than usual with a resulting decline in profit margins at the same time the respondents reported that merchants have significantly cut their own purchases from their suppliers and that these cutbacks have helped to reduce retail inventories similarly the buffalo branch directors observed that merchants in western new york have met with success in moving goods and in reducing inventories to manageable levels this has been achieved however only through sharp markdowns with correspondingly adverse effects on profitabilityreduced demand according to a number of respondents appears to be putting some downward pressure on prices among others the president of a large nationwide retail organization stated that prices of basic raw materials and of some intermediate goods have softened considerably and that while posted prices of most finished consumer goods were holding firm consumers were benefiting from the sales promotion programs mentioned above the chairman of a large new york city bank stated that there was growing evidence that prices were now rising much less rapidly and that in view of sales promotions and discounting the official price indices were probably overstating the rate of inflation a number of top officials of industrial firms mentioned price reductions in their industries including textiles wood products and some metal products it was also noted however that prices of other products including auto parts paper and certain chemicals were remaining firmconcerning capital spending the respondents in general agreed that the outlook had weakened significantly in recent months among others the new york city banker mentioned above looked for further cutbacks especially in consumer goods industries another director felt that while many businesses are committed to capital programs for 1975 and 1976 they are hesitating to make commitments beyond 1976 at this time the buffalo directors in general agreed that 1975 capital spending plans were sharply cut in the latter part of 1974 in their views firms experiencing drastically reduced sales have no alternative but to further cut back from their planned capital spending during 1975 in order to cope with worsening liquidity problemsunemployment in the second district has continued to rise rapidly new york city northern new jersey and buffalo have been especially hard hit with unemployment rates well above the national average in the view of most respondents however the rise in unemployment has thus far exerted little moderating influence on wage demands this view was summed up by the buffalo branch directors who felt that while rising unemployment may be having a moderating effect on upward wage pressures in nonunionized small to medium sized firms there was no evidence of a less aggressive posture by the large unions representing workers in major industries indeed it was noted that some union leaders are preparing for battle and likely to accuse management of using the current economic slump as the basis for harsh negotiations affording labor less than acceptable contract settlements
741,742,3-12-1975,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,second district directors and other business leaders who were contacted recently on balance took a rather dim view of the nearterm economic outlook but most expected a turnaround in business activity during the later part of 1975 the retail sales picture remained uninspiring particularly in new york city more encouraging was the reported significant reduction in retail inventories and the improvementalbeit limitedin certain manufacturers inventory positions comments regarding business capital outlays reflected a note of caution in that sector there continued to be reports of a softening of prices of certain raw and semifinished products and at the retail level of further price concessions including a spreading of the rebate device the district unemployment rate continues well above the nationwide average although the most acute problems seem to be concentrated in new york city buffalo and northern new jerseynone of the respondents commenting on the swiftness of the deterioration in the economy foresaw a bottomless downward spiral considerable uncertainty however surrounded the timing of the turnaround with the respondents in general looking for a recovery to take place later than suggested by some official forecasts among others the chairman of a large airline stated that at this juncture he saw no indications of a turnaround as yet the chairman of a large metal producing firm expected the upswing to be delayed until the start of the fourth quarter when he looked for an improvement in auto sales as new models were introduced among the buffalo branch directors those from the buffalo area which has been hit especially hard by the downswing felt that it might well be yearend 1975 before the turnaround takes place on the other hand a director from the rochester area where business activity has remained relatively strong expected the turnaround by summer or early fall among other respondents the chairman of a diversified international chemical concern stated that the recession would be worse than had been generally expected and the chairman of a conglomerate stated that he could not get enthusiastic until retail sales picked up and would not predict when that would occurregarding consumer spending new york city department stores following a poor january had another poor month in february similar conditions prevailed in buffalo sales elsewhere in new york state continued to perform somewhat better than in the states two largest cities an official of a trade association reported that while sales at some new york city stores had picked up somewhat business at others had declined and that on balance february sales at city department stores would be somewhat lower in dollar terms than in february 1975 on the brighter side however his impression was that there had been a slight improvement in recent days a view also expressed by some retailers moreover he reported that the merchants he has been in contact with were somewhat more optimistic than last month and looked for an upturn as the spring season gets underwaya number of reports indicate that further progress has been made toward reducing retail inventories in good part reflecting significant cutbacks in merchants purchases from their own suppliers in this context the chairman of a very large new york citybased department store chain with branches across the country stated that while his firm had been badly overstocked last november it has now managed to significantly reduce its inventory position he also felt this was true of the retail industry generally similarly a senior official of another nationwide department store chain stated that as a result of an aggressive reduction program his firms inventories were now 20 percent below their level in the comparable period in 1974 at the manufacturing level the chairman of a chemical firm reported that his firm had reduced inventories to desired levels and the chairman of a health and cosmetics products manufacturer stated that his firm had no overstocking problem another observer noted that while there has been a general attempt by industry to reduce inventories a decline in sales has partly frustrated such efforts in some casesa note of caution characterized comments on capital spending a director stated that businesses were attempting to restore liquidity positions and as a result were scaling down large projects one of the nationwide retail firm officials mentioned above reported that his firm was completing stores at shopping centers that were already on the way but was putting little new on the books one of the metal producers reported that his firm had completed a new aluminum plant but was not putting this plant on stream at this time because of the softening in the demand for aluminum an airline official stated there were 100 to 250 too many jets available for the airline industry he further predicted that the airline industry would show zero profits in 1975regarding prices the nationwide decline in wholesale prices was reflected in reports of price declines for a number of primary products including copper brass fibers and raw materials used in the health and cosmetics industry at the retail level there were further reports of price concessions in connection with promotional activity and of a spreading of the rebate device to such products as cameras sewing machines and home appliances in the new york city area rebates are being offered on purchases of condominiums and on leases of luxury apartmentsthe district unemployment rate continues well above the national average in large part reflecting the high jobless rates in new york city northern new jersey and buffalo the unemployment rate for new york state rose to 93 percent in january it was 106 percent in new york city where many of the citys principal industriessuch as dressmaking printing construction and retail tradeare acutely feeling the downswing in economic activity in buffalo the rate was up to 134 percent reflecting the downturn in the auto steel and machinery industries
753,754,4-9-1975,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the overall impression that emerges from the responses of second district directors and other business leaders that were contacted recently is a slowing down in the rate of decline in business activity and that the economy might be approaching a bottoming point although retail sales in real terms continued below last years levels retailers reported some improvement in the recent past and in general were cautiously optimistic regarding the outlook for the second half of the year good progress toward the reduction of excessive inventories at the retail as well as at the manufacturing level has apparently been made the majority of the respondents felt that most large cutbacks in business capital spending plans had already occurred and there were scattered indications that housing activity might pick up in the coming monthsviews expressed by retailers regarding consumer spending were mixed but on balance were somewhat more optimistic than in previous months a senior official of a nationwide chain of department stores reported that following a sluggish performance in the first two months of 1975 his firms business had improved somewhat in march possibly because easter came early this year while he did not expect a pronounced improvement over the near term he was hopeful that sales would pick up smartly in the second half of the year especially in the fourth quarter an official of a high quality new york city department store with branches in the suburbs reported that sales over the easter season had been much stronger than expected and expressed guarded optimism regarding the outlook over the coming months similar sentiments were expressed by a number of other retailersthe retailers however in general were not overly sanguine regarding the impact on consumer spending of the tax rebate provided for in the new tax bill the chairman of a large new york city department store did feel that such rebates potentially might have strong psychological impact on consumer attitudes and provide some help to the retail business other respondents however were more restrained one retailer noted that it might have some favorable impact on consumer spending but that it was hard to determine to what extent the buffalo branch directors felt that the restoration of consumer confidence was the key to increased consumer spending and that the new tax bill would be only mildly stimulative despite expected widespread use for debt reductionperhaps the most positive development reported by most respondents was rapid progress made toward reducing excessive inventories at the retail level the official of the nationwide department store chain reported that his firms inventory had been reduced sharply and was not at a desired level and indeed for certain lines somewhat below desired levels he felt that this was true for the retail industry generally and that the firms suppliers at the wholesale as well as the manufacturing level were also making good progress in that direction other retailers reported similar experiences the chairman of a large new york city bank noted that industry had approached the problem of inventory reduction with unusual vigor once it was recognized at the retail level including the auto industry the worst part of the problem should be out of the way by midyear while further reductions at the basic materials level are likely to continue for most of the year a buffalo branch director felt that many industries have now reached their desired inventory levels and that the process should be completed by midyear or before a senior official of another large new york city bank who last month had stated that too many manufacturers were maintaining excessive inventory positions now felt that on the basis of conversations with his banks directors and corporate clients good progress toward reducing such inventories had been made since thenregarding business capital spending the chairman of the new york city bank mentioned above stated that major cutbacks in plans for such outlays probably have already been made such cutbacks were particularly pronounced among utilities and consumer goods related industries capital spending plans in basic materials industries have held up well a situation he expects to continue given the inadequate capacity for the long run in these industries the buffalo branch directors in general considered it unlikely that further large cutbacks in capital spending plans would occur there already has been an intensive reevaluation of such programs and projects which met the more stringent profitability tests would move ahead on schedule the executive vicepresident of a large new york city bank stated that the worst of the cuts in capital spending plans were behind us such cuts were announced at the turn of the year when in his view the economic outlook appeared gloomiest he felt that the atmosphere had now brightened and that the capacity ceiling in a number of industries could be reached again rapidlyconcerning home building activity the buffalo branch directors did not see any signs indicating an early upturn in such activity even though mortgages were more readily available at declining rates in their view the high cost of home ownership and the lack of consumer confidence were major deterrents to an upturn in the housing industry other respondents were slightly more optimistic this attitude was best summed up by an official of a trade association who pointed to the massive inflow of funds into second district thrift institutions and to the easing of mortgage loan terms and reported that some albeit quite limited recovery in new commitments by these institutions was just getting under way he also noted that the inventory of unsold new houses was smaller in new york state than in certain other parts of the country because of the latter situation however he felt that the 2000 tax credit toward the purchase of a new house provided for in the tax bill would have only a limited impact on housing activity in this district
765,766,5-14-1975,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,second district directors and other business leaders who were contacted recently in general were restrained in their assessment of the retail sales picture although some retailers were reported to expect business to pick up in the nottoodistant future views were mixed regarding the outlook for consumer prices some businessmen indicated an inclination to raise prices by cutting production if necessary while some others expected reduced demand and excess capacity to exert downward pressure on prices the respondents generally agreed that good progress was being made toward reducing inventories to desired levelsthe buffalo branch directors in general felt that the demand for automobiles and other consumer durable goods would remain depressed through the rest of the year and perhaps into 1976 these poor prospects were attributed to the continued lack of consumer confidence high prices unemployment and in the case of appliances to the questionable outlook for an upturn in homebuilding during the balance of the year several of the respondents were also restrained in their assessment of the current retail sales picture a survey of new york citys major department stores conducted by a local newspaper revealed that these stores in april had suffered the biggest yeartoyear decline in sales in five years reflecting in part cool and rainy weather conditions as well as high unemployment in the city on the brighter side retailers were reported to be generally optimistic and to believe that business in the city must pick up soon in this context another respondent expressed the belief that consumers were reaching the end of stretching out their inventories of automobiles appliances and other goods a development he felt was a good sign for the economy generallyregarding the outlook for prices a senior official of a large new york city bank felt that most manufacturers and processors wished to maintain their current prices even if this means cutting production in the face of reduced demand the president of a large textile concern indicated that his company intends to increase its prices when it has the opportunity several other respondents expressed similar intentions on the other hand the buffalo branch directors and several other businessmen looked for continuing downward pressure on retail prices throughout most of 1975 in their view reduced demand and unutilized capacity should lead to heightened competition which in turn should be manifested in lower pricesthe respondents on balance agreed that although many businessmen do not yet feel comfortable with the current level of their inventories a good deal of progress has been made in reducing such inventories to acceptable levels indeed a number of respondents reported that in the case of their own firms or industries desired levels had already been attained or soon would be reached thus among others the president of a large chain of department stores reported that his firms inventories were now in line with estimated sales a senior official of another retail concern reported his firms inventories to be down 15 to 20 percent from a year ago an upstate new york businessman stated that some retailers in his area report low inventory levels another director commenting about the automobile parts industry noted that inventories of finished goods in that industry have now reached nearly acceptable levels and that stocks of raw materials would probably be worked down to desired levels within the next two months
777,778,6-11-1975,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the overall picture that emerges from the views expressed by second district directors and other business leaders who were contacted recently is one of a further moderation in the rate of the economic decline if not of an actual turnaround retail sales rose strongly in may further progress has been made toward reducing inventories and district crop prospects look good the auto and construction industries continue to display weakness however and the demand for bank credit remains softthe retail sales picture brightened considerably over the past month according to a survey by a local newspaper sales at major new york city department stores which had been running below last years levels during the first four months of this year were nearly 4 percent higher this may than in may 1974 while retail sales for the entire metropolitan area were 54 percent higher than a year ago according to an official of a trade association new york city area merchants have become markedly more optimistic on the basis of his contacts with local retail firms he reported that while the may increase was in good part accounted for by increased apparel sales sales of major appliances and furniture had also increased he felt that the improved retail sales atmosphere was due largely to a strengthening in consumer confidence with the tax rebates playing only a minor part the president of a nationwide department store chain felt that consumer purchases of durable goods would likely increase as economic recovery takes hold a sentiment shared by other respondents the buffalo branch directors reported strong retail sales in western new york in may in some areas as high as 15 percent above a year ago and expressed optimism that consumer spending would remain strong at least through early summer the respondents however were generally cautious regarding the nearterm outlook for automobile sales several businessmen expressed the view that auto sales might not improve significantly until the introduction of the 1976 models the president of a large steel firm stated that he was cautious regarding auto sales but he noted that millions of autos continue to be scrapped yearly and that a hidden demand must be building upregarding inventories the retailers reported a substantial decline from high levels at the turn of the year although the president of the department store chain mentioned above felt that durable goods inventories remained high the president of a steel corporation reported that his firm was reducing its stocks on hand and that the firms customers have rapidly reduced their inventories which should be at normal levels by the beginning of july the president of a nonferrous metals producer on the other hand observed that despite inventory liquidation stocks of metals other than steel remain at high levels among senior officials in the chemicals industry several reported inventories under control although one felt that his firms stocks were still too highturning to agriculture a buffalo branch director with farming interests reported that spring weather conditions have been ideal for crop planting if the favorable weather conditions continue through harvest time the prospects are for very high yields in most crops the high yields are expected to result in lower prices in general except for certain vegetable crops where the carryover from last year was particularly low beef prices are expected to remain strong but lower prices are anticipated for eggs and poultry productson the darker side none of the respondents expressing views on the subject were optimistic over the nearterm outlook for the construction industry among others a senior official of a large new york city area savings bank reported that as a result of a large inflow of deposits in recent months his bank had much more funds available for mortgages than there was demand for such funds and he did not expect a turnaround in construction activity for at least four to five months some observers noted the recent tendency of depositors to shun higheryielding certificates of deposit in favor of regular savings accounts suggesting that they may be building up liquidity for withdrawal in the near term the buffalo branch directors generally felt that the 5 percent tax credit and the large inflow of savings deposits had not provided a stimulus to residential construction sufficient to overcome the depressing effects of the uncertainties arising from current economic conditions and high construction costs they expected a gradual recovery in the housing sector but felt a quick return to the high levels of 1972 and 1973 does not seem likely
790,791,7-9-1975,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,second district retail sales developments have turned mixed since the vast improvement witnessed in may while some retailers report continued strong sales a number of them have apparently experienced some slippage in sales for the most part district retailers are comfortable with the current level of their inventories excessive stocks persist in a number of lines at the manufacturing level however most industry observers remain gloomy about the outlook for residential construction in spite of the pickup in sales of new homes regarding the price outlook a number of respondents were fairly optimistic that price increases will be restrained in the near term but many expressed fears of a resurgence of inflationary pressures over the longer runrecently we asked our directors and a number of other business leaders about their opinions on the danger of a nearterm resurgence of inflation in view of the apparent bottomingout of the recession most respondents felt that for the near term high levels of unused human and capital resources will help to restrain price increases there was a strong undercurrent of apprehension about the longer run price outlook however with particular concern voiced over excessively stimulative fiscal policies for example the president of a large chemical firm felt that while a nearterm resurgence of inflation was a possibility his real concern was over the longer term similar sentiments were expressed by the buffalo branch directors among other respondents the president of a large department store chain stated he expected some firming of prices by yearend while another observer felt that wholesale prices for many industrial goods were bound to rise in order to cover rising costs the chairman of a multinational oil company expressed the fear that excessively expansionary fiscal measures to stimulate the economy might reignite inflationary pressures similarly a senior official of a large new york city securities firm stated that his greatest concern was fear of renewed inflationary pressures under the impact of massive budget deficits and union demands for large wage increasesthe district retail sales picture has turned mixed in the wake of the almost uniformly buoyant sales in may most of the respondents commenting on developments in the upstate new york region reported that retail sales in june had run 3 to 7 percent below sales in the comparable period a year ago although some reported sales continuing above yearearlier levels similarly sales at most new york city department stores after improving strongly in may apparently fell back in june in some cases to levels below those of 1974 on the other hand the chairman of the new york outlet of a nationwide department store chain characterized the sales picture as very good not only at the new york store but nationally the president of another large department store chain observed a continuation of the improved sales at his firm that had begun in may he expressed the view that this continued improvement heralded the longawaited upturn in consumer spendingregarding inventories a number of respondents felt that the liquidation of stocks at the retail level had about run its course indeed one retailer expressed the belief that most retailers had been understocked since february there were however reports of continued inventory excesses at the manufacturing level for example one director noted that steel inventories still remained at a high level as well as those of textile fibers the president of a nonferrous metal firm reported that there were still significant inventories of metals and metal products the buffalo branch directors felt that while inventories in general have been reduced to acceptable levels spotty excesses still prevailed in some lines including certain agricultural products furniture and new automobilesthe respondents in general were less than sanguine regarding the residential construction picture several noted the recent improvement in sales of newly built homes but qualified their remarks by pointing out that such sales were still below those of the comparable period last year a director felt that a gradual improvement in housing demand would continue but that it would take a long time before housing starts reach two million units annually again an upstate banker expressed the belief that the residential construction industry was still a long way from being in good health and a senior official of a large thrift institution felt that an upturn in housing was not yet in sight because of the high cost of construction
802,803,8-13-1975,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,recent observations by second district directors and other business leaders indicate a continuation of the gradual improvement in business conditions noted in recent months retail sales in july were generally stronger than in june and there were some indications that retailers were starting to replenish inventories at least in a small way there continued to be reports of excessive inventories at the manufacturing level but the list of items in excess supply has narrowed substantially the demand for business loans at banks has shown little buoyancy as yet but some indications of a forthcoming strengthening of loan demand were noted regarding wages the respondents generally expected this years increases to be smaller than last yearsretail sales have strengthened somewhat over the past several weeks despite considerable rain and unseasonably cool weather through most of july sales at most major new york city department stores were slightly higher than in july 1974 with an even stronger performance shown by stores in the suburbs in june sales in the metropolitan area had been lower than in the comparable period last year similarly the retail sales picture in upstate new york was reported to be brighter than in june with sales also running above last years levelviews on retailers inventory policies were mixed the president of a large nationwide department store chain reported that efforts to build up inventories have begun although as yet only to a limited extent similarly the president of an upstate department store stated that to a small extent retailers in his area were building up inventories a senior official of a conglomerate felt that on the basis of his firms sales merchants were cautiously building up inventories of apparel automobile parts and accessories and more aggressively storm doors thermopane windows and similar items the president of a nonferrous metal firm reported increased sales of his firms kitchen utensils line and believed that in general retailers were relaxing their inventory policies one director on the other hand stated that retailers were still maintaining a relatively conservative approach in their inventory policies similarly the buffalo branch directors saw no evidence of efforts to build up retail inventories in western new york but rather felt that the emphasis continued to be on inventory reductions and improved inventory controlsthere were some indications of continued excessive inventories at the manufacturing level for example the chairman of a large new york city bank stated that in some cases inventories of materials used in the production of durable goods remained excessive the president of the metal firm mentioned above reported excessive inventories in the electrical goods industry and among aluminum producersalthough not among the latters customers other respondents cited instances of still excessive inventories of various items including steel zinc canned food and furniturethe respondents in general reported little increase in business demand for bank loans but some very tentative indications of a forthcoming strengthening of demand were noted for example the chairman of a major new york city bank observed some increase in requests for longterm loan commitments on the other hand a director observed that many companies were seeking to stretch out repayments of outstanding loans rather than enlarging their lines of credit however an upstate new york banker reported a small firming of loan demand at his bank and a new jersey banker noted a modest increase in construction loans at the same time several respondents opined that the resumption of inventory accumulation in some lines will result in stronger loan demand before longregarding the wage picture virtually all respondents agreed that wage increases would be more moderate this year than last year particularly but not exclusively for nonunion workers among others an official of a conglomerate stated that workers were dreadfully afraid to be laid off and that this would be reflected in substantially more moderate wage demands than last year the president of a rochester department store definitely expected weaker labor demands buffalo branch directors cited instances where employees have foregone wage increases to preserve jobs
815,816,9-10-1975,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the gradual improvement in business conditions indicated in recent months by observations of second district directors and other business leaders remains in evidence according to our respondents the retail sales picture continued to improve in august and early september and some retailers reported they were now understocked in some lines business capital spending however remains weak the weakening of business loan demand in the district appears to have abated and most loan officers contacted recently looked for a pickup in demand in the near future the strengthening of the dollar on the foreign exchange market in general was believed to be likely to have little impact on u s tradeperhaps the brightest spot in the current economic situation has been continued improvement in the retail sales picture the president of a nationwide chain of department stores reported that his firm had cashed many federal income tax rebate checks while this suggested that a large part of the rebates was spent rather than saved the retailer anticipated consumer demand for general merchandise to continue to rise well into 1976 he reported that his company which had experienced a large inventory overhang a few months ago was now understocked in apparel lines retail sales in upstate new york which already had been picking up in recent months improved further in august and resort areas were reported to have had a very good tourist season although retail sales in new york city continued to lag behind the nationwide performance reflecting in part the high rate of unemployment in the city sales at large department stores showed the best improvement since september 1974 this improvement moreover appears to have continued in early september merchants were generally optimistic and reported very good business over the labor day holiday when many large department stores remained open an even better performance was shown over the past month at stores in the suburbson the darker side business spending on plant and equipment apparently remains weak for example the president of the department store mentioned above saw no evidence of a reactivation of capital spending plans in his industry noting that the current emphasis was on increasing the productivity of existing facilities rather than on expansion the chairman of a multinational oil company stated that business capital spending in general appeared to be lower than had been expected last spring he reported that his own firm had cut its investment plans for 1975 by 100 million before the year began and by another 300 million in january because of deteriorating profits the buffalo branch directors also saw no evidence of a reactivation of capital spending plans that had previously been shelved with one director citing continued excess capacity escalating building costs and relatively high interest rates as factors inhibiting capital spending an upstate banker in a resort area however reported on plans for expansion of tourist facilitiesa number of respondents expressed concern over a possible resurgence of inflation among others the president of a large nonferrous metal firm stated he was fearful about inflation he pointed to the currently low pricecost ratio in his industry and to the large proportion of capital spending for environmental protection adding nothing to productive capacity these factors he felt would put upward pressure on materials prices the chairman of the oil company felt that the current spending pattern with consumers outlays rising while business capital spending was not could well have inflationary implications and the buffalo branch directors believed that fear of a resurgence of inflation was a major factor behind businessmens currently cautious moodregarding the demand for business loans the buffalo branch directors reported no further weakening in such demand as did the majority of the loan officers at commercial banks in and outside new york city who were contacted recently moreover nearly twothirds of these loan officers expected loan demand to be stronger over the coming months with virtually all others anticipating no changewe recently asked our directors and other respondents about their opinions regarding the possible impact on united states foreign trade stemming from the strengthening of the dollar on the exchange markets most respondents felt that this impact would be negligible they agreed that this strengthening had not significantly eroded the competitiveness of u s exports to date and was not likely to do so in the future and that imports would not be spurred significantly in their opinion u s prices of goods continue to be attractive visavis those of foreign goods because of the greater rates of inflation experienced by many other countries a senior economist at a large new york city bank stated that the strength of the dollar in recent months was only a rebound from an undervalued position the present rate in his view is nearer the equilibrium rate and is more desirable over the longer run the chairman of the oil company thought that the strengthening of the dollar should make opec countries less aggressive in raising oil prices this fall the president of the nonferrous metal concern however believed the stronger dollar to have been a factor in the increase in aluminum and stainless steel imports
827,828,10-21-1975,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,according to second district directors and other business leaders consumer demand should continue to provide the major nearterm impetus to the business recovery respondents at the retail level sensed rising consumer confidence and they generally expected a better christmas season than last year however a strong upturn in residential construction and capital spending does not appear imminent despite continued industrial slack most of those questioned foresaw inflation in the 6 to 8 percent range because of underlying cost pressures some respondents felt that new yorks financial plight might have some impact on the business recoveryprospects appeared good for further improvement in retail sales the buffalo branch directors cited higher personal savings and less indebtedness as strengthening the financial position of households and consumer confidence expectations were for a better christmas season than a year ago some respondents reported good gains in apparel but the chairman of a new york citybased department store chain did note that furniture sales had been lagging however the department store chairman foresaw a strong nearterm profit performance for the retail industryoutside of the retail area the outlook was not so optimistic no one expected any quick and marked improvement in business fixed investment or in residential construction a number of respondents from industrial establishments mentioned present pricecost margins as unfavorable to a rapid resurgence of investment the president of a large multinational oil company was pessimistic with respect to the petroleum industrys ability to finance the capital expenditures required to meet the nations energy needs he regarded higher prices for domestic petroleum products as a necessary but not sufficient condition for generating needed cash flows the chairman of a large concern manufacturing capital goods had yet to see any signs of recovery as bookings were still quite weak no further recovery in residential construction was foreseen by the directors of the buffalo branch because of such factors as previous overbuilding and high construction costs however an economist for a new york city brokerage firm expected declines in both inflation and longterm interest rates to provide an eventual uplift to the housing sectordespite the presence of forces which might ease price pressures a number of respondents were uneasy with the prevailing degree of inflation and some feared an eventual reacceleration of inflation among the factors cited as dampening price rises were continued slack in productive facilities increased price competitiveness of foreign goods in industries such as chemicals and competition among petroleum refiners faced with low capacity utilization on the other hand some respondents were concerned that a steady rise in wages energy costs and environmental control costs could push inflation upward one new york citybased clothing manufacturer said that textile prices had started to recover toward last years high levels and that delivery lead times were lengthening as some suppliers were unprepared for the quick turnaround in the apparel sector although not particularly fearful of a marked reacceleration of inflation the buffalo branch directors generally expected a 7 to 8 percent rate of price rise while there was no expectation that price controls would soon be imposed a few respondents feared that discussion of price control might trigger widespread anticipatory price risesa number of respondents felt that the new york financial crisis did pose some risk to the economy however most of those questioned did not think that the crisis would totally undermine the recovery the buffalo directors thought that the recovery might be temporarily delayed but expressed more concern with the probable reallocation of funds away from municipal securities on the other hand they felt that the longerrun implications could be favorable if the current crisis prompted greater financial responsibility at all levels of government there were reports of concern expressed by some european foreign exchange dealers that default could have an unfavorable psychological impact on the dollar a quite pessimistic note was sounded by the president of a large new york citybased construction firm specializing in government sponsored construction through new york state he offered a bleak outlook for area public construction as unsettled conditions in the municipal bond market had virtually halted major new commitments
839,840,11-12-1975,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,concern over the new york city financial crisis and its possible repercussions was generally expressed by second district directors and other business leaders that were contacted recently a number of the respondents however felt that the impact of the crisis has now been discounted in the financial markets the retail sales picture continued to improve with merchants looking forward to a good christmas season there was no evidence of a change in businessmens cautious attitudes toward capital investments business inventory adjustments in general were thought to be at or near completion with scattered exceptionsnotably some basic metalsthe district economic outlook continues to be adversely affected by the financial difficulties of new york city and new york state which as noted by several respondents are now inextricably linked the chairman of a large new york city bank a director reported that he and a number of other leading bankers felt that a default might have a grave impact on the market for taxexempt securities throughout the nation and on financial institutions holding such securities the president of a nationwide chain of department stores thought a default might have a strongly adverse impact on the current business recovery some observers noted that the layoffs associated with the citys budget cuts were adding to the already serious unemployment situation in the area and might well have secondary effects on the job situation in private industry similar sentiments were expressed by several other respondents the buffalo branch directors however were on balance somewhat less concerned while they generally agreed that a new york city default would create some problems upstate most felt that these problems would not be overwhelming and that much of the possible impact of a new york city default had already been discounted moreover these directors saw a healthy sign emerging from the situation in the increased awareness of the importance of fiscal responsibility on the part of both voters and government officialson the brighter side the retail sales picture continued to improve a survey by a local newspaper indicated that sales at large new york department stores in october were about 5 percent higher than in october 1974 despite the unseasonably warm weather in the latter part of the month that tended to hold down sales of fall and winter apparel the chairman of the large chain of department stores mentioned above expected a good christmas season with sales at least 10 percent higher than last year another leading retailer noted that retail business had been accelerating over the past four or five months a development he felt augured well for the holiday season indeed most of the respondents expressing an opinion on the subject looked for a good christmas buying season a number of directors noted that the new automobile models had been well received especially the smaller cars emphasizing fuel economy these directors felt the outlook for auto sales was favorable at least through mid1976 according to a number of respondents there has been no significant change over the past month in business plans for plant and equipment outlays with caution remaining the prevailing attitude one director however saw evidence of some pickup in longerrange capital investment planningregarding inventories most respondents agreed that there now is generally very little evidence of excessive inventories that most inventory liquidation is completed or nearing that point and that whatever additional adjustments are still needed should be completed by mid1976 the chairman of a large department store chain stated that textile inventories were low and reported that his firm recently had difficulties in obtaining some of the more popular retail items there were reports however of stillexcessive inventories in some sectors including some basic metals electric machinery lumber and construction items tires and console televisions
852,853,12-10-1975,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,consumer spending notwithstanding its sluggishness in recent months is expected to provide the principal nearterm stimulus to the economy according to the views expressed recently by second district directors and other business leaders business capital spending remains lethargic although a number of respondents felt the longerterm need for such outlays might well be building up the respondents on balance looked for a continued modest improvement in residential construction loan demand was generally characterized as weakthe retail trade industry continues to provide the brightest element in the economic outlook the president of a large nationwide chain of department stores thus characterized the outlook for the christmas buying season as glowing he reported that after a slow start in november which he attributed to unfavorable weather conditions rather than to a lack of consumer confidence nationwide retail sales had risen sharply in the recent past and that he was very optimistic regarding the prospects for the postchristmas season he stated that while retail sales in new york city were not doing as well as nationally he felt that even there the outlook was relatively favorable a survey by a local newspaper indicated that november sales by large new york city department stores were only 35 percent higher than during the comparable period a year ago with merchants attributing this relatively poor performance to the adverse effect of the threat of a city default the 11percent unemployment rate in the city the citys generally troubled economic conditions as well as unseasonably warm weather through much of november sales by the suburban branches of these same stores however were substantially higher and the combined sales of these stores and their branches were nearly 7 percent higher than in november 1974 the chairman of the citys largest department store reported that his firms sales in the metropolitan area remained strong and was generally optimistic regarding the outlook over the coming months new york city apparel manufacturers moreover reported a strong pickup in orders associated not only with the christmas season but also with the spring and easter season observers reported the outlook for the christmas buying season in western new york to be favorable citing a healthy consumer attitude toward spending adequate savings and an increase in real disposable income as contributing to this favorable outlook one exception was the buffalo area where a retailer reported sales trends to be spotty and the outlook not encouragingregarding business capital spending most respondents saw little evidence of a nearterm pickup in that sector among others the chairman of a multinational oil firm stated he had not noticed any change in the conservative attitude toward plant and equipment outlays in the petroleum industry and the president of a nationwide retail firm reported that in general retailers continued to act cautiously toward the opening of new branches or the expansion of existing facilities the president of a multinational nonferrous metal concern indicated that his firms customers were planning only the absolutely essential capital expenditures he felt that businessmens generally conservative spending intentions were linked to the uncertainties surrounding the 1976 economic outlook and the vigor of the current recovery several respondents however indicated that underlying pressures for capital outlays might be building up a senior official of a large paper firm thus stated that he placed little faith in official capacity utilization data which he felt incorporated a great deal of obsolete facilities moreover he noted that over the coming years the paper industry would be obliged to invest 1 billion or more to meet the requirements of the environmental protection act several other respondents including senior officials of utilities metal container manufacturing and chemical firms expressed concern over the magnitude of the outlays their firms and industries would have to undertake to comply with this act the chairman of a large new york state utility thus stated that while there might not be an immediate demand for capital expenditures in the public utilities sector the eventual expenditures for environmental control facing the industry were a real sleeper a number of respondents also expressed concern over the high and rising cost of replacing existing facilities and the adverse impact of this development on their firms cashflow positionswith respect to residential construction several respondents viewed immediate prospects as relatively poor or only slightly improved reflecting the high cost of construction and maintenance the continued availability of existing houses and apartments and the uncertainties regarding the economic outlook the president of a manufacturing firm however expected further moderate gains in singlefamily home construction and a considerable comeback of apartment buildings over the next 15 months and a senior official of a thrift institution in a resort area reported that construction activities in his area had picked up in recent weeksregarding loan demand loan officers at large banks in general reported a weaker demand than they had anticipated late last summer and did not look for any significant pickup over the near term the buffalo branch directors characterized the current and prospective state of loan demand as stagnant and unlikely to improve significantly until mid1976 at the earliest the president of a retail firm however expected loan demand in the retail industry to increase as retailers rebuilt inventories similarly the president of a nonferrous metal firm felt that corporate loan demand has begun to show signs of reviving as inventory accumulation and capital outlays in certain sectors recover
864,865,1-14-1976,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the business outlook for 1976 on balance is relatively good in the views of second district directors other business leaders and financial economists who were contacted recently real gross national product gnp is expected to grow over the year the christmas and postchristmas retail selling seasons have been successful while retail sales continue to provide the main prop under the recovery some respondents expected some reinforcement from the inventory accumulation now underway and after midyear from business capital spending the outlook for corporate profits was for the most part regarded as goodwe recently requested our directors and a number of financial economists for their appraisal of the business outlook for 1976 in varying degrees the respondents in general were cautiously optimistic among others the president of a large nationwide department store chain expected real gnp to grow by about 5 12 percent over the year he expected consumer spending to continue to provide the principal stimulus during the first half of 1976 and to be reinforced by a pickup in capital spending by midyear he felt unemployment would decline throughout the year but would remain above 7 percent in his view barring poor crops there was hope that the rise in consumer prices could be held in a 5 to 7 percent range the chairman of a large new york city bank also felt business capital spending might pick up after mid1976 the buffalo branch directors generally agreed that the business outlook was reasonably good at this time with attractive interest rates and generally good consumer confidence as factors supporting this favorable outlook a senior economist at a large new york city bank expected a good balanced and sustainable expansion this year with real gnp growing by 5 to 5 12 percent as yet however he saw no evidence of any significant pickup in capital spending in real terms he expected such outlays to rise by 8 to 10 percent in dollar terms with a token increase in real terms in the last part of the year this economist also expressed some worry over the possible impact on inflation of the potential terms of the settlements of the many wage negotiations coming up in 1976 another bank economist stated he was cautiously optimistic on 1976 and that the recovery was taking hold and should result in a rate of real growth of 5 to 6 percent in his view a very reasonable performance under present conditionsas noted consumer spending continues to provide the main thrust to the current economic recovery in this regard the president of the large chain of retail stores mentioned above reported that the christmas selling season had been good to excellent with sales exceeding expectations even in new york city where sales have lagged behind the nationwide performance the chairman of a large new york city department store reported the holiday season had ended on a very strong note with sales intensifying the closer christmas approached similar observations were made by a number of other new york city retailers a survey of large new york city department stores revealed that christmas and post holiday consumer buying had lifted their december sales to a level 8 percent above december 1974 the largest increase in 16 months the performance in the suburbs was even better with sales in the metropolitan area nearly 11 percent over the comparable period of 1974the biggest increase in 23 months district sales outside the new york city area were also strong an upstate banker noted that holiday sales in his area had substantially exceeded expectations the buffalo branch directors were in general agreement that the christmas selling season in western new york had been good with sales in dollar terms running 810 percent above yearearlier levels these directors moreover reported that the holiday season increase in retail buying has been followed by good sales so far in 1976 in their view however the mood of consumers appears to be mixed consumers have discretionary spending money and seem to show little resistance to spending for recreation travel and smallticket items inflation job insecurity and economic uncertainties in general however tend to be reflected in a more cautious attitude toward the demand for big ticket itemsregarding corporate profits the great majority of the respondents looked for an increase in 1976 among others the president of the retail chain stated that the outlook for such profits was excellent as productivity was improving dramatically while the volume of sales was rising against this background he expected profits after taxes to gain about 30 percent next year for the same reasons one of the bank economists expected profits to rise throughout 1976 also by 30 percent for the year all of the buffalo branch directors also expected corporate profits to increase in 1976 in reflection of emphasis on expense control coupled with increased consumer spending their estimates however ranged from rather modest increases to as high as 25 percent above 1975 exceptions to the rather optimistic profit outlook were voiced by directors associated with the petroleum and the metal industries who did not expect these industries to fare well during 1976
876,877,2-11-1976,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,second district directors businessmen and business and financial economists who were recently contacted generally indicated that they were encouraged on the outlook for continued economic recovery in their view business inventories are now in reasonably good balance with sales expectations with inventories thus realigned most respondents felt that businessmen would pursue cautious inventory policies in the coming months with stocks growing in line with sales a minority of respondents on the other hand felt that any strengthening of demand should stimulate efforts to stockpile metals and would quickly drive up prices for the most part however inflation was seen as moderating somewhat further except in a few trouble spots some concern was also voiced over the large wage and benefit settlements that are likely to be demanded in forthcoming collective bargaining negotiations liquidity problems however were generally not viewed as posing any significant threat to the recovery this yearthe inventory situation was generally described as in good balance with sales indeed according to one director manufacturers were being if anything overly cautious in their inventory building the buffalo directors expected firms to maintain tight inventory control although they saw prospects of cautious and watchful inventory buildup the chief economist of a major chemical company whose firm had only recently escaped from a tremendous inventory overhang confirmed that his company was holding a tight rein on inventories the president of a major metal company observed that inventories in his industry had finally been brought into reasonable alignment with current sales he felt that any strengthening in demand would prompt purchasing agents to aggressively seek to accumulate inventories among other sectors one financial economist looked for increased liquidation of agricultural stocks held over from 1975 and also wondered whether severe cold weather would sharply reduce stocks of residual fuelson the outlook for price increases a majority of respondents expected inflation to diminish in coming months led by slower growth in food prices at the same time however price pressures were seen developing in a number of sectors the chairman of a major new york city bank expected overall prices to rise in a range of 5 to 7 percent for the balance of the year buffalo directors agreed with this assessment expecting prices to increase 6 percentsomewhat below the recent rate of increase a slowing in agricultural prices was viewed as one of the primary factors contributing to a slowdown in the rate of inflation a director with agricultural interests expected food prices to decline and noted that there was already some evidence that this was occurring an investment banking economist looked for a slowdown in fuel price increases in coming months as the result of the lifting of the crude oil tariff less encouragingly he foresaw nearterm pressures on metals prices developing the president of a major metals company also expected rapid industrial wholesale price increases as a result of tight operating margins in most industrial concerns shortterm upward pressures on paper and lumber prices were seen as a remnant of the canadian mill workers strikeon a related subject a senior economist at a major manufacturer that is facing heavy collective bargaining this year felt there was little chance of any abatement in the rapid firstyearofcontract wage gains that marked last year in his view moreover nonunion wage gains would accelerate in order to catch up from earlier imbalances he expected hourly compensation to increase at least 9 percent during 1976 reflecting not only rapid wage and benefit increases but also cyclical increases in hours of overtime work and changes in the mix of employment among industries another business economist on the other hand expressed the view that continued high rates of unemployment would help to restrain wage increases in the nonunionized sector even if some major unions won exceptionally generous settlementsquestioned on the possibility that liquidity problems might retard economic recovery this year the directors felt these uncertainties had largely faded into the pasteither having been resolved or close to being resolved in their view the supply of funds was more than ample to support the continuation of a moderate recovery the chairman of a major new york city bank did note however that bank lending policies were more conservative and qualityoriented but could not determine if this would become a significant drag on the economy another director observed that financial institutions had apparently become more aggressive in the mortgage market while not foreseeing any nearterm balance sheet imbalances several economists of nonfinancial corporations were concerned over the longerterm capital problems stemming from the insufficiency ofinternallygenerated funds to meet prospective needs for capital investment
890,891,3-10-1976,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the pace of the nationwide economic recovery remains strong indeed may be gathering momentum according to second district directors and other business leaders who were contacted recently the improvement in consumer confidence that emerged toward the yearend continued unabated during the past month business inventories by and large are in line with sales and in some instances on the low side while the outlook for business capital spending has begun to brighten the economic upswing in this district however has lagged behind that in the nation generally as reflected in the relatively high level of unemploymentregarding consumer spending the president of a large nationwide chain of department stores reported that his firms general merchandise sales were quite strong in february and were substantially above last years depressed levels he said he was encouraged by the continued strength in consumer spending thus far this year coming as it did on the heels of a very good christmas season a senior official of a large consumer goodsoriented conglomerate expected further improvements in the demand for certain lines of home furnishings and for color tv sets and reported a strengthening in the firms car rental business a financial economist felt that a strong improvement in consumer confidence was underway citing as evidence the recent shift in the demand for cars from small to larger vehicles comments regarding retail sales developments in the second district however were somewhat more restrained a senior official of a large buffalo department store reported that retail sales in that city had been somewhat sluggish during the past month in large part because of bad weather he felt reasonably optimistic however that sales during the spring season would rebound sharply from the depressed levels of a year ago similarly a banker noted that while auto sales in the buffalo metropolitan area were still lagging stronger sales were being enjoyed by dealers in other areas of the country this observer saw developing evidence of a shift in consumer attitudes from caution to optimism the president of an upstate bank reported good retail sales in his area over the presidential holidays while the president of a buffalo suburban bank indicated that sales in the buffalo suburbs were stronger than in the city with local merchants expecting further improvements in new york city february retail sales by large department stores paced by sales of apparel topped yearago levels by 45 percent as against 35 percent in january and a decline of 42 percent in february 1975 suburban stores also put in a stronger performance than city stores with retail sales for the entire metropolitan area rising by 7 percentthere were further reports that business inventories in general have now been brought down toand in some instances belowdesired levels among others the senior official of the conglomerate mentioned above noted that following a big adjustment of inventories in 1975 his firms stocks were now generally well aligned with sales the president of a new york city area bank felt business inventories were low while the chain store executive indicated that retail inventories were fully under control another observer stated that on balance business inventories had been reduced to the point where businessmens attempts to restock could be expectedturning to the outlook for business plant and investment outlays the buffalo branch directors agreed that while at this juncture businessmen continue to make capital outlay decisions cautiously evidence of a more optimistic approach was emerging senior officials of several nonfinancial concerns stated that while their firms currently were planning little change in the level of their capital outlays for 1976 as compared to 1975 no further decline was contemplated for this year the president of the retail chain felt that new store expansion will continue in the retail sales industry although the major emphasis will remain focused on increasing the productivity of existing facilities the president of multinational oil corporation observed that while as yet he saw no change in business attitudes toward investments in plant and equipment he expected the tempo of capital outlays to quicken hand in hand with a continued improvement in business conditions a financial economist opined that against the background of the strong state of consumer spending the outlook for business outlays for plant and equipment had brightened substantially in recent weeks he reported revising upward his earlier projections of no real growth in capital spending for 1976 and now expected such spending to gather momentum in the third quarter and especially in the fourth quarterthe comparatively lagging state of the district economy was most clearly evidenced by the generally poor employment picture in new york city the unemployment rate not seasonally adjusted rose from 115 percent in december to 122 percent in january the highest level since world war ii the rise for new york state was slightly greater from 103 percent to 111 percent the highest level since the depression against this background concern was expressed that the state economy would slip further behind the national economy unless more favorable tax environmental and regulatory policies were pursued by the state several respondents in the buffalo area where that citys unemployment rate is the highest in the state also cited obsolete plants and equipment heavy tax burdens high labor costs and shifting markets as contributing to the continued closing or relocation from the buffalo area of plants and outlets conditions remain even more depressed in puerto rico where the unemployment rate is reported to have risen from 199 percent in december to 219 percent in januarythe demand for business loans remains sluggish according to most respondents expressing a view on the subject primarily because of the currently high levels of corporate liquidity several respondents however expected such demand to rise in coming months as the economic upswing gathers momentum moreover several upstate bankers reported that while business loan demand remained flat in their area the demand for mortgage and consumer loans had intensified
902,903,4-14-1976,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,a steady recovery continues to characterize the business outlook according to the views expressed by second district directors and other business leaders who were contacted recently consumer spending remains strong business inventories are down to levels where some rebuilding may be required to keep in line with sales capital outlays are still sluggish but are generally expected to pick up and residential construction appears to be strengthening on the darker side the district unemployment picture remains bleakall indications point to continued strength in consumer spending the president of a nationwide chain of department stores reported that retailers were generally optimistic 1976 is expected to be a good year and there is nothing on the horizon that might hurt business this year he felt that consumers were being less price conscious and reported that higher price items were selling well the vicechairman of a multinational electrical products firm noted strength in the sale of consumer durables and expected such sales to remain strong throughout 1976 an economist for a multinational nonferrous metal producer noted that despite the stepped up consumer buying such outlays have not kept up with the rise in consumers real income opening prospects for further growth in the pace of consumer spending similar sentiments were expressed by several bank economists regarding the district retail sales picture the president of the nationwide chain mentioned above stated that his firms new york city area stores have been doing well as well as anywhere else while sales at large new york city department stores during march were only about 5 percent above march 1975 in part reflecting the later easter date this year area merchants expected sales during the marchapril period to substantially exceed those of last year an upstate banker reported that sales in his area continued strong while the buffalo branch directors reported that after a sluggish start spring consumer buying in western new york had come on strong especially during the last days of march and early april larger retail stores were reported to be doing particularly wellas in recent months respondents felt that the continued strength in retail sales had found its counterpart in the termination of downward adjustments in business inventories and in emerging evidence that the rebuilding process was getting underway among others a business economist stated that retail stocks are obviously too low as a result of a greater than expected volume of sales and that manufacturers and wholesalers will also have to be adding to inventories to keep up with sales growth another observer a financial economist felt that with consumer spending running ahead of expectations some businessmen found it difficult to avoid a drop below desired levels in their stocks of certain products in strong demand the consensus however was best summed up by the buffalo branch directors who felt that businessmen have learned to live with lower inventorytosales ratios through improved inventory management techniques but that with mounting confidence in the economic outlook these businessmen were cautiously rebuilding inventories these directors expected such rebuilding to accelerate as spending for capital goods increasedregarding business capital outlays several bank economists and other respondents reiterated the view expressed in recent months that these outlays could be expected to pick up as business activity continued to expand however as yet there is no concrete evidence that a significant pickup has gotten underway in this sector senior officials of two nationwide retail firms reported that their firms maintained a cautious and selective attitude towards the opening of new outlets the president of a machinetools producer reported a substantial rise in inquiries by businessmen but little increase in actual orders similarly the official of the electrical product firm reported heightened interest in bidding but that this interest has not been translated into action and indeed that his firms backlog of orders for industrial equipment actually was offreports were mixed regarding the current construction picture but on balance suggested some improvement unrented office space in new york city was reported to have declined about 8 percent over the past year a business economist stated that the current moderate recovery in the housing industry should continue through this year and next with mortgage money readily available and with demographic pressures and the pentupdemand for housing built up during the 2 years of recession providing momentum for steady gains in housing starts similarly a financial economist pointed to the strong jump in residential contract awards in february as auguring strength in the construction not only of single family homes but of apartments as well the buffalo directors reported that major builders of luxury class homes in western new york were doing a brisk business one director pointed to the increasing demand for building lots as indicating a probable future strengthening of construction and the directors in general felt that the availability of mortgage money in their area was sufficiently adequate to promote substantial further improvement in home building on the more restrained side the chairman of a large new york city bank reported that construction of commercial structures and of condominiums continued sluggish and could be expected to remain so over the near term on the basis of his firms weak sales of plumbing material the official of the nonferrous metal firm felt the demand for new homes remained lackluster while several upstate directors reported continued weakness in the building of low to moderate priced homesthe district unemployment picture generally remained bleak but there were indications of a slight improvement the unemployment rate not seasonally adjusted for new york city edged down to 12 percent in february from 122 percent in january and for new york state to 109 percent from 111 percent these rates had continued to increase in january a director associated with an automotive product firm reported that his firms output and employment were well ahead of prerecession levels reflecting the improved demand for automobiles the local labor market however continues very slack for example a major buffalo area food processor who announced openings for 200 workers received 3000 job applications on the first day
914,915,5-12-1976,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the economy continues to recover smartly according to second district directors and other business leaders who were contacted recently significant further growth in gnp is expected over the coming year consumer spending for the most part remains buoyant residential construction is beginning to recover in the district and there continue to be expectations of a turnaround in capital goods outlays nevertheless some apprehensions have been voiced about potential future shortages of steel and other metals against this background prices are expected to begin rising more rapidly and forthcoming wage negotiations to result in substantial settlementsall of the respondents expressing an opinion on the subject felt that a brisk economic recovery would be sustained over the balance of the year several noted that the economy had performed better during the first quarter than they had expected among others the chairman of a multinational chemical corporation expected the upswing to continue to gather strength from greater than anticipated consumer demand a director associated with the automotive industry reported that on the basis of recent domestic auto sales he had raised his expectations for real gnp growth for 1976 from 6 to 7 percent the president of a large metal producing firm reported that demand for metals was increasing somewhat faster than had been expected earlierthe latest survey of the buffalo purchasing management association points to further significant improvement in the demand for locally produced goods with virtually all respondents reporting a steady or increased flow of new orders and nearly half reporting an improvement in the volume of new orders as compared to only 13 percent so reporting a year agoas in previous months consumer spending generally continued to be characterized as strong the buffalo branch directors reported that retail sales over the easter shopping period had been very strong and good gains were also posted in suburban areas of the new york city region some slowing in early may in the rate of growth of department store sales in the buffalo area as compared to last year was noted but this was attributed in good part to the spurt in consumer outlays during the comparable period last year under the impact of the tax rebates in any event this softening was not apparent in the rochester area moreover a number of respondents reported the demand for automobiles in upstate new york continuing very strong with some dealers having depleted inventories of certain models the retail sales picture in new york city however was less favorable april sales of large city department stores notwithstanding the later easter this year registered a disappointing advance of only 33 percent from the yearearlier levelless than the rise in general merchandise priceswhile retail sales and the more recent rebuilding of business inventories continued to provide the main thrust to the recovery there were further indications that the hitherto lagging capital investment and residential construction sectors might be picking up a financial economist thus felt that even the 4 percent increase in real business plant and equipment spending in 1976 implied by the latest mcgrawhill survey was too low in his view a rise of nearly 6 percent was probably more appropriate several other financial economists reiterated their expectations that capital outlays would pick up as the recovery proceeded the residential construction picture continues to brighten in most parts of the district with the notable exception of new york city an official of a new york state thrift trade association reported that mortgage money was in substantially greater availability than last fall and that even 90 percent mortgages were now being made in certain suburban areas surrounding new york city and buffalo the buffalo branch directors reported that there was clear evidence of an upswing in housing construction in western new york the improvement has been particularly apparent in prime suburban areas but has also been evident in the lowtomoderate priced residential sector apartment construction remains in the doldrums however under the influence of high vacancy rates in some areasregarding the price outlook the official of the chemical concern mentioned above expected the rate of increase in wholesale prices to approach a 78 percent range by yearend and expressed concern over the prospects of shortages in steel and certain other metals the latter concern was also expressed by some other respondents a director noted the sharp increase in metals prices which he felt might reflect some speculation but also the fact that in his view profit margins remain very low in most basic commodities a director associated with agriculture stated that he was not as optimistic as the department of agriculture regarding the 1976 grain harvest and that in his opinion higher grain prices are in the offinganother director expressed the view that it appeared unlikely that the underlying rate of inflation could be kept down below 6 percent given the present state of consumer demand fiscal policies and of wage pressures in the latter context a number of directors expected fairly strong wage demands from organized labor with firstyear settlements ranging from 8 to 10 percent in union contracts and with nonunion wage increases lagging only slightly behind
926,927,6-16-1976,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,overall capacity constraints are not expected to materialize this year or early next year according to second district business leaders directors and industrial analysts current production rates are below most industries capabilities and the few shortages that exist appear limited to isolated product lines respondents appear less sanguine about the longerrun outlook however one after another they complained of the disincentives to investment caused by environmental and safety legislation consequently little outright addition to capacity is foreseen and many observers are apprehensive over bottlenecks and shortages emerging toward the close of 1977while on the whole substantial plant capacity remains to meet increased production high utilization rates in some industriesnotably paper steel and textilessuggest that some capacity problems could develop within the coming year a senior official of a trade association expected full capacity utilization in the paper industry to be reached by mid1977 in this officials view high utilization rates were already building inflationary pressures the chief economist of a major paper producer felt certain lines especially newsprint were already at capacity but expected production to stabilize as inventory building subsided one director felt there were clear indications of possible steel shortages largely owing to tightness in foundry capacity an industry analyst of a leading securities firm however discounted the current evidence he emphasized that while production was tight for steel products associated with automobiles substantial slack existed elsewhere he argued that since auto production is unlikely to accelerate steel capacity should remain adequate textile industry respondents generally felt that capacity utilization while high would not reach its upper limit in the near termin the wake of the severe bottlenecks created by shortages a few years ago everyone surveyed appeared to be sensitized to signs of developing shortages on the whole business leaders and industrial economists reported that raw materials are currently plentiful and they generally did not anticipate nearterm shortages the few exceptions citedsome chemicals such as chlorine and possibly cotton fiberswere not viewed as likely to create significant bottlenecks the buffalo branch directors generally discounted the risk of a reemergence of shortages of industrial materials in the foreseeable future in their view the lengthening of lead times for steel and for certain chemical and paper products was attributable to an unwillingness on the part of firms in those industries to activate marginal facilities and to rehire marginally productive workers until the upward trend of orders became more pronouncedan official of a major auto manufacturer and other observers felt that barring an exceptionally long walkout the rubber workers strike would not substantially impinge new car production inventories were expected to hold through the end of july as auto manufacturers have acted to conserve their stockpiles and tire production has not been cut as drastically as originally estimated moreover due to the modelyear changeover auto plants will be idle for two to three weeks over the summer thus our respondents did not expect auto production to be seriously affected before the end of july one however did mention the likelihood of short supplies of some types of truck tires before thenon the energy front supplies look ample except for natural gas the chairman of a major oil firm emphasized that shortages of natural gas were likely if the winter were severe his fears were echoed by a major industrial user of natural gas who recognized the likelihood of service interruptions that would curtail production in the winter natural gas prices were seen as rising rapidly the president of a major international oil firm felt that minor production problems could be created because of the changing mix of soursweet crude highlow sulfur content crude resulting from increased imports spot gasoline shortages were expected by the senior economist of a petroleum firm but he felt they would be temporary and localized over the longer term the chairman of a major coal mining firm felt price pressures in his industry would intensify as a consequence of safety and environmental mandatesconcerns over the impact of environmental legislation on capacity growth dominated the discussion of the longerrun outlook for capacity utilization although respondents felt that real capital spending would increase they discounted the potential impact on capacity citing requirements for increased unproductive spending on pollution abatement and safety equipment this legislation was also viewed as blunting the incentives for increasing capital investment in addition uncertainty over constantly changing environmental laws and regulations was viewed by the vice president of a diversified chemical firm as hampering effective planning of longterm expansion projects and raising the riskiness of investments in the textile industry one company analyst felt that additions to productive capacity would decline 5 to 10 percent in the coming year the buffalo branch directors stressed additional influences prompting businessmen to approach plant and equipment investment with caution and reluctance in this regard they mentioned fears of a possible resurgence of inflation and lack of confidence in government
938,939,7-14-1976,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the economic recovery in the second district continues to lag behind that of the rest of the nation but recent developments have not materially altered the assessment of district directors and business leaders who were recently questioned about the economic outlook merchants do not appear overly concerned by the softening of retail activity which they regard as temporary but they are generally following tight inventory policies on the financial front business loan demand continues to languish in new york city although a few directors reported scattered evidence of a pickup outside of the city commercial banks in new york have begun to respond to the challenge of checking accounts at mutual savings banks by eliminating or lowering checking feesconsumer spending in this district remained sluggish overall in june although there were mixed reports of an upturn the president of a major pharmaceutical concern reported a slowdown in some consumer markets in may and june the controller of a major new york city department store also reported that sales continued weak in june in western new york state the buffalo directors found little indication of any significant increase in consumer spending except for automobile sales on the other hand a rochester retailer found junes sales though soft stronger than mays many stores in an effort to limit inventory accumulation have begun to mark down merchandise prices earlier this year than usual in this connection a senior official of a nationwide chain specializing in apparel and other soft goods said his firm planned june and july markdowns that are greater than normalbeyond their cautious inventory policies retailers do not appear overly concerned by the softening of sales activity and have not altered their fundamental assessment of the future respondents believe that consumer spending will pick up again in coming months but do not expect an upsurge as strong as that experienced early in the year echoing this view the president of the pharmaceutical firm discounted the downbeat findings of recent consumer confidence surveys arguing that they have no predictive value but merely confirm current market conditions in the view of buffalo directors consumer confidence remains favorable as inflation decelerates and real income risesoutside of the retail business sector most other respondents did not appear concerned over inventories the president of a large distributor of electric equipment said his companys inventories were in great shape the treasurer of a metalfabricating company reported that his once massive inventory overhang had been eliminated and that overall inventories were now just about at optimal levels an economist for an oil company felt his firms inventories were generally in a normal range with gasoline stocks being built up in anticipation of future tightnesson the outlook for wage pressures directors of the buffalo branch felt that demands for wage increases have moderated somewhat the president of a large utility reported that his company is experiencing record low job turnover and felt that this may allow him to break out of the national pattern of pay increases respondents however remained wary of aggressive wage demands of unions one director who is associated with the automotive industry felt that the relative moderation of wage demands in that industry was due to the fact that pressures for catchup pay increases were largely behind us an official of a nationwide retail chain termed the wage situation in his industry as stable with only a small fraction of his work force unionized he felt that the abundance of unskilled workers eliminated economic pressures to raise wagessurveying the financial scene business loan demand in new york city continues to languish and respondents do not see signs of a turnaround however the chairman of a major new york city bank indicated that there were signs of recovery in loan demand at some rural and regional banks outside of the central money markets in new york state mixed evidence on this point was offered by various directors one reported loan demand was flat in central parts of the state while another cited an incipient recovery in the binghampton areawhile new york city loan demand remains sluggish competition for demand deposits has developed as a result of mutual savings banks bidding for commercial bank customers recent legislation now permits mutual savings banks in new york state to issue non interestbearing demand deposits a trade association for these thrift institutions indicated that as of the end of june threefourths of its membership 84 out of 118 members were offering these accounts in the few weeks that the accounts have been available deposits have grown rapidly and already exceed 100 million in response to this rapid growth and aggressive marketing by savings banks commercial banks have begun to eliminate or substantially reduce checking chargeswhile the regional recovery generally continues to lag the national economy there were some encouraging developments in the districts employment situation the new york state unemployment rate not seasonally adjusted declined 06 percentage points to 89 percent in may the first time in 30 months that it was lower than a year earlier in buffalo where joblessness has persistently been the worst in the district the unemployment rate fell from a high of 121 percent in march to 104 percent in may this is also well below its 115 percent rate of may 1975 after holding steady at 107 percent in march and april the new york city unemployment rate fell to 101 percent this improvement is somewhat illusory however since it was caused less by an increase in jobholders than by a reduction in the work force indeed new york citys recovery from the recession has fallen further behind that of the nation the citys unemployment rate in may was 34 percentage points higher than the national rate while in january this difference was only 26 percentage points of the five downstate counties surrounding new york city each registered improvement in the jobless rate but only one had a rate below the national average
950,951,8-11-1976,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the second district economy continues to have difficulty gaining momentum according to district directors and business economists contacted recently regional retail sales apparently softened in july with the weakness heavily concentrated in apparel however sizable inventory imbalances were avoided for the most part largely as a result of cautious purchasing policies further improvement in home building appears uncertain with high prices and a backlog of unsold homes restraining construction of singlefamily units and few signs of any pickup in multiplefamily residences overall the regional economy still lags behind that of the nation in large measure because of the prolonged slump in activity in new york cityconsumer spending in the second district slowed in july retail sales in new york city were characterized as sluggish by department store executives directors from the buffalo area reported that aside from the auto sector july sales softened considerably from june and sales in the first few days of august gave no indication of marked improvement the president of a rochester retail store indicated that the weakness was general throughout the state an official of a trade publication felt that to a large extent the weakness stemmed from a slowdown in spending on apparel and that buyers appeared to have become value conscious despite this softness the president of a major nationwide retailer which specializes in apparel did not expect the slowdown to continue in coming months some respondents noted a change in the mix of consumer spending as purchases of appliances apparently have held upretailers appear to be very cautious in building inventories responding quickly to changes in expected sales growth as evidence of this virtually every analyst contacted cited the fact that large inventory buildups did not accompany the sales slowdown nevertheless some imbalances remain in the composition of inventoriesold spring and summer stock versus new fall lines directors of the buffalo branch reported that promotions and markdowns had only limited success in moving merchandise a senior official of a national retailer said his chains markdowns would continue into august a business analyst reported that outright order cancellations were rare but that many retailers appeared to be limiting or delaying ordering new merchandise and were planning instead to reorder if demand proved sufficiently strongcontinuing problems with multifamily building were seen as limiting prospects of a pickup in the rate of recovery of residential construction a senior economist of a major appliance manufacturer felt that home building was in a bind created by an imbalance between personal income and the high carrying and downpayment costs of a new home the large backlog of unsold units was seen by another analyst as further restraining any nearterm acceleration in activity one director reported some spotty pickup in housing activity in central new york state outside of residential activity a regional analyst thought that public construction spending in new york state would remain at a standstill for the near term commercial activity was seen as possibly recovering modestly with the building of shopping centers and storesoverall the regional economy continues to lag behind that of the nation to a large extent this is due to the failure of the new york city economy to revive over the first half of the year estimates suggest that the city accounted for almost nine out of every ten jobs lost in the state total employment in new york city seasonally adjusted has continued to decline to be sure private employment appears to have stabilized but at the lowest level since record keeping began in 1950 the rate of joblessness in the city is some 3 percentage points above the national average even this wide differential disguises the depth of the metropolitan areas slump however because a substantial reduction in the labor force has been an important factor in holding down the unemployment ratein addition to the weakness of the citys economy a commercial bank economist felt that part of the economic sluggishness of the region reflected the importance of capital goods production in upstate new york as a mature region with older less efficient plants the upstate region responds to a revival in capital spending with a lagreportedly moving ahead with vigor only when national capital spending is well into an expansionas to the overall outlook for the national economy a senior economist of a financial firm was highly optimistic expecting a longlived recovery and a sharp moderation in inflation on the other hand another senior economist expressed apprehension over the danger of a future pickup in real growth with concomitant upward price pressures an economist of a major business equipment producer looked for deceleration in real growth but anticipated a favorable price performance with regard to industrial materials prices the president of a major metals firm felt that while there would be further increases a relative breather was likely compared with recent previous months a nonferrous metals economist viewed as likely an additional copper price increase late in the year with the possibility that the price of aluminum ingots would rise early next year the buffalo directors felt that with substantial agricultural production in prospect price pressures in this sector would be modest
962,963,9-15-1976,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,scattered signs of pickup in the pace of business activity in the second district were reported by directors and businessmen who were contacted recently in early september there appears to have been a substantial rebound in new york citys retail sales the strength of this improvement was so pronounced that merchants expected its momentum to carry through the remainder of the month other sectors of the regions economy appear much less buoyant and continue to lag behind the nations recovery in the view of respondents inventory investment appears unlikely to be stepped up significantly and while capital spending is increasing it has gathered little momentum in this district the financial scene reflects these developments with loan demand showing few signs of revivingretail sales in and around new york city appear to have gained substantial momentum in recent weeks executives of several leading department stores reported a surge in consumer buying activity that began with the labor day weekend one department store official characterized sales as tremendous and other respondents felt that sales gains were substantial and well above typical holiday and backtoschool buying the pickup was large enough that a vice president of a national retailer observed that new york sales which had been lagging the rest of the nation had now caught up to the nation the pickup in buying cut across all product lines but smaller kitchen and personal care appliances were pointed to as leading the advance in one department storein the view of at least some merchants sunday openings have been an important factor in adding further impetus to the recovery in consumer buying major department stores in new york city and the metropolitan area last month began to open their doors on sundays and sunday openings appear to be gaining acceptance among retailers most retailers were convinced that sunday hours have added substantially to total sales rather than merely redistributing daily sales within the week in addition to providing a shopping day to those who work on saturday merchants noted that heads of households were more likely to shop on sunday thus increasing the likelihood of bigticket or credit buying whatever the cause of the acceleration in consumer activity most retailers expected the momentum to carry through the monthdirectors of the buffalo branch were less sure of the upturn in consumer spending and were generally gloomy over prospects of the fall selling season the reluctance of consumers to spend was attributed to a lack of sufficient confidence as well as continued concern about job security the president of a buffalo department store chain reported august sales were below a year ago however at the same time the chief executive of a major rochester retail firm stated that conditions had improvedwith respect to the outlook for business fixed investment spending second district directors reported little evidence of a stepup in capital spending plans the chairman of a multinational oil company observed that the percentage increase in petroleum industry spending would exceed the rate of price increases one executive in the electrical construction business reported a shift from governmental to private spending as limited evidence of a revival of capital spending plans in western new yorkcapital goods production in the district continues to lag however most producers report some pickup in new orders but business remains below their earlier expectations the corporate treasurer of an industrial machinery producer termed the overall recovery of new orders spotty one machinery equipment manufacturer felt that part of the flatness of his order book was due to buyers holding back orders until after the september machinery show in chicago new orders at a tractor and crane manufacturer had edged up slightly since early summer but the backlog at this firm has been almost completely eroded a major steel maker located in western new york reported that demand for structural steel continued to languish he explained that the operating rate of his firms upstate plant had held near the companys average due to the strong demand for flatrolled products while some of the sluggishness in capital goods production in the region is due to the sluggish recovery in national business spending a bank economist emphasized the maturity of the region in this connection as a result this analyst felt that the regions capital goods industries could be expected to lag behind the national recovery in investment goods demandbusiness inventories by and large appeared to be in relatively good balance with sales most of our directors viewed the early summer increases in inventories largely as the result of weaker than expected sales but none felt that the increases were excessive buffalo directors observed that overall inventory levels were somewhat low in relation to sales and expected moderate stock building over the balance of the year retail respondents appeared to be relatively satisfied with their salesinventory balance but reiterated that tight controls were being held on inventories one electrical machinery manufacturer however reported that inventories were high and that his firm was in the process of working them downsecond district bankers saw little evidence of a recovery in business loan demand as yet in new york city although some recovery was observed in some outlying areas for example one director noted signs of a sustained recovery in business loan demand in the binghamton area most of the second district bankers contacted outside of new york city expected loan demand to strengthen during the next several months but a majority of the new york city bankers foresaw flat loan demand for some time to come
974,975,10-13-1976,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the continuing improvement in economic conditions in the second district appears to have been sustained in the face of the apparent slowing in the pace of the nationwide recovery judging from comments of directors and other business leaders who were contacted recently the strengthening in retail sales in new york city has carried into early october and appears to have spread into other parts of the region while capital spending continued to lag there are scattered reports of a pickup the rate of joblessness in the region appears to have stabilized and the gap between the regional and national unemployment rates has narrowed on the outlook for prices respondents generally felt that inflation was moderating gradually and that the recent resistance to attempted price increases would help temper the future inflation nonetheless many remained concerned over the prospects of mounting cost pressuresconsumer spending in new york city appears to have retained its newfound strength while for most of the year new york city merchandising has been a weak spot for many national retail chains that situation seems to have changed in recent months the vice president of a national department store chain reported that the increase in september sales for new york exceeded that chainwide average and that while sales in the rest of the country showed signs of a weakening in early october sales in new york city remained strong according to a city department store executive sales were strong in september and were better than expected in early october the pickup in consumer buying appears to have spread outside of new york city as well the directors of the buffalo branch detected a modest improvement in department store sales in september part of this impetus in the recovery in consumer buying may have been due to growing acceptance of sunday openings the head of a large department store chain in the buffalo area noted a marked improvement in sales of the final weeks of september which he attributed to the success of recent sunday openings he expects sunday openings to become a way of life in the buffalo area in new jersey a trade association official noted that although new car sales continued to be more sluggish than nationwide automobile dealers were generally optimistic about the future he also commented that sales apparently had been unaffected by the ford strikecapital spending in the district continues to lag but there has been scattered evidence of a pickup the president of a company producing petroleum and building equipment expected his firms capital outlays which were up 50 percent this year to double next year the president of a manufacturing company was also optimistic concerning plans to augment capacity stating that his firm would be emphasizing machinery and tools rather than additions to plant on the other hand the vice president of a mining concern did not feel that his company would increase capital spending before early 1977 and the president of a maritime corporation stated that his company planned to purchase fewer new ships this year than usualproduction of capital goods in the district continues to lag a national manufacturer of industrial machinery announced a 2 percent reduction in its work force at the same time a major steel producer in western new york announced layoff plans in conjunction with the closing of relatively inefficient blast furnace facilities directors of the buffalo branch however expected the nearterm prospects for new orders production and employment in steel and other heavy industries in western new york to be strong one director whose firm is a major purchaser of steel contended that press reports were misleading in conveying the impression that recent cutbacks in steel production reflected weak demand rather in his view they were primarily attributable to a spreading out of existing orders to achieve more efficient productionwhile the recovery in the regions economy since the trough of the recession has still not matched the national recovery there have been some encouraging signs in the employment situation of late the seasonally adjusted unemployment rates of both new york city and state held steady from june to august despite an increase in the national rate furthermore in recent months the slide in the citys private employment appears to be coming to a halt indeed for the new yorknew jersey metropolitan area private employment increased in july for the first gain in almost three yearson the outlook for price increases a majority of respondents expected inflation to diminish slowly in coming months the president of a national retail store chain thought the recent sluggishness of the economy would have a moderating influence on pricesboth materials prices and product prices consistent with this view the chief economist for a paper company stated that prices of his firms products had softened recently and the vice president of a company dealing in minerals said that demand conditions had not allowed cost increases to be passed on the chairman of a major new york city bank felt that the recent resistance to attempted price increases was encouraging and a healthy development in helping to assure the continuation of the economic expansion other respondents echoed this view and generally felt that there was little danger of a return to doubledigit inflation the president of an international oil firm expected industrial prices to increase 5 to 6 percent over the coming year the buffalo directors expected prices of industrial materials to rise about 6 to 8 percent during the next six to nine monthsalthough there was a consensus that inflation was likely to diminish strong cost pressures remained a matter of concern to a number of respondents one director expected major wage settlements to continue in the neighborhood of 10 percent a senior economist of a major manufacturer also thought that the momentum for large wage increases still remained indeed he felt that wage increases might become larger as certain groups of workers sought to regain their relative positions in the wage structure because this economist felt that the bulk of cyclical productivity gains had been exhausted he expected upward pressures on prices to remain strong with prices rising by a minimum of 6 percent in 1977 on the other hand the president of a major chemical firm anticipated that employees would become less aggressive in their wage demands as a result wage settlements would moderate slightly perhaps to a rate of 812 percent an investment banking economist felt that price expectations would wind down causing wage pressures to moderate the president of a retail store gave another reason for wage moderation he expected that businessmen would toughen their bargaining stances as they experienced difficulty in raising prices
987,987,11-10-1976,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,conditions in the second district continue to improve moderately according to district directors and other business leaders department store sales in new york city have been strong for the past two months and consumer spending elsewhere in the district also appears to have gained momentum at the same time there are also signs that capital goods production in the district may now be picking up on the outlook for the national economy the business leaders contacted have not altered in the face of the recent economic slowdown their view of a moderate but steady expansion over the next year with only a few exceptions inventories were judged in good balance with sales less encouragingly many business leaders voiced concern that the ford motor company settlement would tend to strengthen somewhat labor demands in future negotiationsconsumer spending in new york both in the city and upstate appears to have strengthened and merchants expect a strong christmas season according to leading city retailers since sales turned up around labor day they subsequently continued to post sizable gains while the turnaround coincided with the movement toward sunday openings most retailers feel it is still too early to estimate the impact of such openings several department store executives attributed part of the october strength to unseasonably cold weather which sparked purchases of outer wear the vice president of an association of retailers agreed that soft goods were now selling better reports from upstate new york also indicate that consumer spending has gained considerably the head of a leading department store in buffalo said results for october were the best so far this year a banker director noted a considerable pickup in consumer borrowing which he attributed to automobile purchases in this strengthening environment most retailers are expecting a healthy christmas buying season that would carry over into the first half of 1977concerning the general outlook for the national economy the consensus view was that the recent slowdown in growth would not adversely affect the pace of economic activity over the next several quarters indeed one director pointed out that the rate of growth in final sales had not slowed down at all he predicted moderately faster growth over the winter and spring followed by some slowing in the second half of 1977 directors business leaders and economists alike felt that despite the recent slowdown the nearterm outlook remained one of moderate but steady expansionthe recent slowdown had not created any substantial inventory imbalances and overall inventories were in good shape in the unanimous view of respondents one isolated sector where inventory imbalances were thought to exist was in the metals industries especially steel and copper which were frequently mentioned as being topheavy one director however did feel that the situation in steel had largely been corrected the chief economist for a diversified company thought that chemical inventories were high while an executive of a chemical concern considered them to be comfortableone effect of the economic slowdown has been to allay fears of nearterm shortages and capacity constraints in july a senior official in the paper industry predicted that the industry would face capacity problems by mid1977 but in view of current developments this forecast has been revised so that capacity constraints are not expected to develop before 1978 a chemicals executive labeled the capacity situation in his industry as good stating that through careful planning bottlenecks had been eliminated a senior economist of a textile company spoke of considerable excess capacity while a metals executive predicted that shortages would not occur for a year or two few business leaders reported changes in planned capital spending but many complained that the effects of environmental and governmental regulation had severely constrained the growth of capacity uncertainties over proposed environmental legislation and concern over the possible imposition of price controls were cited by several respondents as retarding investment spendingcapital goods production in the district continues to lag but there is some evidence of a turnaround new orders for capital goods have apparently picked up for a number of companies one officer reported a tremendous upswing in new orders primarily in new bookings from the plastics industry the production manager at another plant commented that new orders for sophisticated machinery had been good for some time and now orders for less sophisticated machinery are picking up according to the vice president of an electrical machinery company new orders have been somewhat stronger in recent months and moderate growth is expected in the near future the vice president of a forge company reported that while current capital spending is slow activity is expected to strengthen in early 1977a majority of directors and business leaders seemed to feel that the ford settlement would lead workers to strengthen their demands but few expected the impact to be substantial most directors thought the settlement would lead to demands for higher wages reduced hours or a guaranteed annual wage a number of business leaders agreed that the settlement was likely to encourage other workers to make more expensive demands with one businessman stating that his companys upcoming negotiations would probably be affected on the other hand few thought that the impact economywide would be substantial because few other workers have the same bargaining strength as the automobile workers in one director s view the ford settlement was tailored to the interests of a particular union and would not therefore cause other workers to alter their demands an analyst in a brokerage house agreed that other workers were unlikely to accelerate their demands as a result of the settlement because in large measure the ford contract was in line with others negotiated this year despite this general consensus the directors of the buffalo branch cautioned that the current united parcel service strike could signal a general strengthening of union demands over the next year
999,999,12-15-1976,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity in the second district appears mixed but the outlook remains favorable according to directors business leaders and analysts contacted recently retail activity apparently slowed in late november after strengthening progressively since labor day this pause in momentum caused merchants to temper some of their holiday optimism but nonetheless a good sales picture was expected for december as a whole at the same time automobile sales were expected to be higher in coming months as inventories of popular models increase respondents in this district pointed to a few inventory excesses but generally felt there was a good balance with sales on the price scene while discounting is common in a number of industries and product lines respondents generally felt that the recent price increases on certain metals and fibers probably would holddistrict merchants reported a slowing in the growth of sales in november after two months of strong gains nevertheless retailers generally remained optimistic about december a vice president of a leading new york city department store termed november sales as rather disappointing but said he expected the christmas season this year would be late another city retailer agreed that sales were not up to expectations but he too was hoping for a substantial christmas one department store executive predicted that his company would post a record fourth quarter in sales in upstate new york as well there were signs that retail sales slowed toward the latter part of november compounding this slowing was a severe snowstorm in western new york that immobilized retail activity in early december reports on new car sales suggest that the district developments reflect national conditions sales of small cars appear to be relatively weak and inventories are still high on the other hand consumer demand for large cars remains strong indeed buffalo observers as well as metropolitan new york city and northern new jersey automobile dealers cited insufficient inventories of large cars as limiting sales retailers reports on inventories were mixedviewed by some as a bit high while considered by others as about rightsuggesting that imbalances were not widespread one senior retail executive stated that disappointing sales in november had resulted in inventory imbalances but that they were not so burdensome as to warrant any special adjustments another retailer reported that inventories were up but he saw no cause for alarm since part of the buildup reflected a decision to carry over some of their surplus of hard goods at the same time several department store officials reported that their inventories were in line with salesin most other industries inventories were generally viewed as in balance with sales although exceptions most notably in metals were cited one director considered inventories of both ferrous and nonferrous metals to be high another director felt that steel inventories were being cut back and an official at a buffalo steel plant agreed beyond these areas inventories were generally felt to be in good balance the purchasing manager of a major industrial firm noted a more conservative materials inventory policy reflecting an easing in concerns over shortages in view of the generally good balance of inventories to sales one business planner predicted that inventories would move up moderately in 1977 as the recovery continueson the price front respondents generally felt increases recently posted on various materials and products would probably stick one analyst specializing in the steel industry stated that he had been expecting the steel industry to raise prices before yearend because of their rising costs unlike the aborted earlier attempt to raise prices the recently announced price hike was scheduled to take effect almost immediately giving steel customers little time to undertake defensive maneuvers because of the accelerated timing the recent price increase was given a good chance of sticking a steel company official agreed that the higher prices would probably hold because in his view the demand for flatrolled products was strong a buffalo director thought that steel companies wanting to pass on their higher product costs would refuse to relent on the price hike irrespective of the level of demand less sure that the price increase would stick was a steel economist for a major chemical company according to him a key determinant was whether or not the demand for automobiles holds up he expressed surprise at the timing of the price increase and suggested that the possibility of price controls might have been a factorwhile discounting is a widespread practice in the aluminum industry the price increase on aluminum sheet is likely to hold in the view of a metals analyst he termed demand in the aluminum sheet lines as strong relative to rolling capacity and felt there was very little discounting in rolled sheet aluminum synthetic textile producers are reportedly following the industry leader in raising prices even though there is excess capacity throughout the industry a marketing analyst for a major textile company thought the price increase would hold
1012,1012,1-13-1977,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,economic conditions in the second district have continued the moderate improvement noted in recent months according to directors and other business leaders contacted recently retail sales ended the holiday season with a flourish after some sluggishness early in the season with a few exceptions inventories seemed to be at desired levels while orders for capital goods have been coming in slowly this was partially attributed to businesses awaiting the policy decisions of the incoming administration the recent price increases of steel and other materials and products were generally expected to hold on the labor scene there were predictions of moderation in wage demands this year but more emphasis on improvements in nonwage benefitsthe consensus among retailers in the second district was that christmas sales turned out very satisfactorily as judged by historical patterns consumer spending started out slowly in december but picked up sharply as christmas neared many retailers characterized the week before christmas as unusually strong within the new york metropolitan area sales were generally regarded to be stronger in the suburbs than in the city upstate one department store executive labeled the christmas season as excellent directors of the buffalo branch on the other hand characterized the holiday season as good but not up to original expectations in their view exceptionally severe weather may have had a dampening effect on sales while some merchandise was marked down prior to christmas most retailers indicated that markdowns were no greater than customary on the other hand two department store executives reported extra promotional activity this christmas early reports on postchristmas sales were very encouraging and most retailers were optimistic in their outlook nonetheless the high level of gift certificates purchased this christmas was interpreted by some as a sign of lingering consumer cautionon the whole inventories were thought to be in good shape a few scattered exceptions were mentioned for example one director pointed out that inventories of nonferrous metals continued to be extraordinarily high at the same time there remained problems with the mix of automobile inventories stocks of small cars were too high although they were improving aided by the rebate programs stocks of intermediate and fullsize cars continued to be tight overall the consensus was that inventories were or soon would be reasonably balanced one business leader however predicted that inventory targets would soon be raised thereby fostering a moderate stepup in inventory accumulationcapital goods producers in the district generally reported that new orders have been coming in at a relatively slow pace of late in the view of two respondents this sluggishness stemmed in part from businesses waiting to see what programs the new administration would propose of particular interest was the decision as to whether or not to raise the investment tax creditan issue that was left unresolved in the announcement of presidentelect carters proposed program of fiscal stimulus capital spending was not expected to rise sharply over the next quarter or so but some business leaders did predict a speedup later in the yearconcerning the price increases recently posted on various basic materials and products most business leaders contacted thought the higher prices were generally sticking despite some reports of discounting an economist for an automobile company reported that although steel prices had been discounted in early december posted prices seemed to have been holding since then an executive in the capital goods industry agreed that price increases for flatrolled steel products appeared to be holding but added that discounting could begin if the automotive industry did not expand production as much as expected with respect to stainless steel and aluminum a director reported that recent price hikes were stickingalthough there was no consensus concerning wage increases for 1977 most business leaders anticipated some moderation from 1976 the rate of inflation was expected to be an important determinant of wage increases a corporate economist pointed out that some of the wage settlements expiring in 1976 were negotiated during the period of wage controls the contracts expiring in 1977 in contrast were negotiated after the wage control program ended implying that the workers covered by these latter contracts have less catching up to do some respondents expressed the view that a high unemployment rate will have a smaller than usual moderating effect because the current high rate of unemployment reflects rapid labor force growth rather than sluggish labor demand nonwage issues including job security fringe benefits and pension provisions were seen by some as especially important in 1977 indeed one executive thought that while wage increases would moderate there would not be much relief from cost pressures another business leader predicted that the recent contract negotiated by the automobile workers would make labor negotiations tougher than usual this year on the other hand directors at the buffalo branch thought that the willingness of labor to work with the new administration would help to prevent serious labor disruptions
1024,1024,2-9-1977,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,fierce winter weather and a natural gas shortage have materially affected economic activity in the second district according to businessmen utility executives and directors of the buffalo branch who were contacted recently the dislocations varied greatly across the districtranging from a virtual halt of business activity in western new york state to scattered commercial and industrial closings in metropolitan new york city most of these firms expected to reopen within the current week because of an easing in the shortage of natural gas notwithstanding the return to production businessmen remain concerned over the prospects of future shutdowns should frigid temperatures reemerge on the general outlook for the national economy business economists viewed the decline in production and employment as a temporary disruption that would be largely made up in coming months on the other hand these economists were less optimistic on the outlook for prices projecting a reacceleration in the rate of inflationcutbacks in production and employment varied substantially across the district the most severe and widespread closedowns were in the buffalo area which was struck by a devastating winter storm in late january as a result of the adverse weather conditions and storm aftermath employees were unable to travel to work and tens of thousands were idled outside of the buffalo area work stoppages appeared to be largely the result of cutbacks in natural gas supplies late in january natural gas suppliers experienced a drastic diminution of stocks due to increased consumption and pipeline curtailments faced with the prospect of cutting back service to residential customers many upstate new york and northern new jersey utilities reduced commercial and industrial service to levels that would only protect plant and equipment from freezing while many firms continued production by switching to alternative fuels numerous closings were reported the buffalo directors estimated that approximately 6000 rochester area workers were laid off due to a shortage of natural gas closer to new york city layoffs and production losses appear to have been relatively much more limited with fewer natural gas curtailments of customers without alternative fuel sourcesconservation measures some moderation of temperatures and purchases of natural gas by utilities produced at least a temporary easing in the natural gas shortages early in february natural gas service was expected to be restored to most business customers within the current week despite this encouraging development firms remained concerned that further service disruptions might occur if adverse weather conditions reappear a director of a major upstate utility emphasized that prolonged cold could result in a major natural gas crisis overall respondents felt that energy shortages were largely limited to natural gas despite this general consensus however several respondents complained of an inability to receive propane shipments due to weatherrelated transportation problems a few businessmen who were able to obtain propane complained of its sharply higher pricewith the restoration of natural gas service most firms felt they would be able to make up for the lost production exceptions were two glassmakers who felt there was little room to make up for lost production since they had already been operating their plants 24 hours a day another exception was in the auto industry where two plants were expected to remain closed an additional week due to shortages of parts and supplies that had been created by plant closings in buffalo the disruptive effects of the extraordinarily severe weather conditions were also reflected in retail activity in the district through the first weeks of january merchants reported that sales were generally good however in the wake of the brutal climatic conditions sales plummeted over the remainder of the month particularly hard hit were stores in the buffalo area which were forced to close for several days in addition many stores in upstate new york in an effort to conserve fuel reduced their hours by 20 to 30 percent even in new york city which was relatively less affected by the adverse weather customer traffic fell below normal as the temperature fell in new jersey stores drastically lowered thermostats or cut hours to meet the governors strict conservation regulations as a result of these various measures combined with the bad weather sales toward the close of january and in early february fell below yearearlier levels despite the overall slowdown in sales inventories were generally described as in good shape merchants did not appear overly concerned by the sluggishness in retail activity which they appeared to regard as temporary and expect to be made up in coming months as the weather returns to normalon the implications of the severe winter for the general economy most business economists felt that it was premature to substantially alter their projections of production for the year an exception to this view was the senior economist of a major appliance manufacturer who was uneasy about describing the effect as similar to a strike he was concerned about the ongoing production constraint posed by natural gas shortages in addition he also felt that due to the heightened sensitivity of consumers and the financial markets to price changes a reacceleration in inflation could have substantial ramifications all of the respondents expected at least a shortrun acceleration in the rate of inflation due to increased fuel and food costs
1039,1039,3-9-1977,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity in the second district has returned to normal following the end of the severe weather and natural gas shortage according to businessmen and directors contacted recently at the retail level spending apparently strengthened progressively over february with sales for the month either meeting or exceeding merchants expectations with the restoration of natural gas service in early february manufacturing output and employment rebounded as many firms stepped up production through overtime to meet order backlogs or rebuild inventories at the same time new orders appeared to have strengthened somewhat and many respondents expected a pick up in fixed and inventory investment respondents were less sanguine on the inflation outlook however expecting increased pressure on prices as a result of the weather problemsproduction and employment appear to have rebounded early in february with the resumption of natural gas service and moderation in the severe weather directors of the buffalo branch stated that in the rochester and buffalo areas many firms were stepping up production through overtime to meet order backlogs or rebuild inventories this strong upward trend in output was most notable in the automotive sector where substantial overtime expenses were incurred to make up productionscattered evidence of a pick up in capital spending was reported by capital goods producers in the district new orders generally were up slightly in february and continued improvement was expected in coming months for the most part production losses due to the gas shortage were expected to be made up many respondents had either increased overtime or have plans to lengthen the work week an exception to this view was the vice president of a heavy machine tools producer who reported that new orders were off in february while expecting overall orders to pick up the construction and mining equipment sectors were weak and he felt that prospects for these lines were less certainon the outlook for capital spending several respondents expected plant and equipment outlays to increase later in the year some of the increase in outlays may result from the natural gas shortage several respondents indicated that they were considering the addition of alternative energy sources for their plants in this vein the president of a major chemical and metals firm reported that the relative price of oil and coal could prompt major conversions to coal he indicated that the costs of changeover at one of his plants were made up in one year directors of the buffalo branch felt that plant and equipment additions would be spurred by tightening capacity utilization resulting from stronger sales and inventory rebuilding the president of a textile firm noted that due to the low level of utilization capital expenditures in his industry would largely be for replacement and modernization an equipment manufacturing executive felt that president carters stimulus package was a psychological plus for business even without a substantial increase in the investment tax credit his company is planning to step up plant and equipment spending in the second half of this yeardistrict merchants reported that consumer spending in february strengthened despite some limited disruptions in sales activity early in the month the consensus among retailers was that it is impossible to estimate to what extent the increase made up for sales lost in january first of all respondents were unsure of the extent to which the january sales disruption was a consequence of the weatherrelated natural gas shortage during the natural gas squeeze a number of retailers curtailed store hours and thermostats were lowered this made shopping less convenient and tended to lower consumer spending on the other hand the unusually cold weather was credited by several retailers with stimulating sales of certain items most notably outerware whatever the cause retailing was apparently back to normal levels for february as a whole and indeed several retailers reported that sales were ahead of expectations a vice president of a major department store reported that recent sales were rather good which suggested to him that they were entering a healthy period of expansionthe disruptive effects of the severe weather were expected to put upward pressure on prices in addition to the obvious effects on food prices due to the drought in parts of the nation the severe weather was expected to influence prices in a number of ways one metals producer reported that the price of lead had firmed recently apparently in response to increased demand for batteries created by the cold an economist of an oil company noted the higher fuel demand resulting from the cold would be met largely through the importation of highpriced foreign oil which would result in higher average petroleum prices in the judgment of several respondents these price pressures are likely to be exacerbated by the inflationary impact of fiscal stimulus measures more positively one respondent felt that the recent increase in prices created by the severe weather would largely prove to be temporarymerely reflecting the inefficiencies associated with low production rates and dislocations he expected an abatement in the rate of inflation as production levels return to normal levels
1051,1051,4-12-1977,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity in the second district has continued to improve moderately according to directors business leaders and analysts contacted recently department store sales have for the most part been satisfactory and several merchants reported that the new york metropolitan area was doing better than the rest of the country this pattern did not carry over to district auto sales however which were lagging the remainder of the country inventory positions were generally considered to be in line with sales although several respondents indicated that inventory building would soon be under way orders for capital goods remained weak government regulations sluggish demand and financial constraints were among the reasons given the buffalo directors did report however that the nearterm outlook for orders in the steel industry had improved finally considerable concern was voiced over the outlook for pricesreports on department store sales in the district were generally favorable indeed several national retailers indicated that in contrast to recent experience sales throughout the new york metropolitan area and the east coast in general were outpacing sales elsewhere in the country certain other new york merchants in contrast found sales a bit disappointing yet even they seemed cautiously optimistic about future sales in upstate new york expectations for the spring buying season were characterized as reasonably good by the buffalo directorsreports on district auto sales were less encouraging although sales nationwide appear to be booming the president of an automobile dealers trade association indicated that so far in 1977 sales in the new york metropolitan area were lagging sales of a year ago uncertainty about economic conditions talk about taxes on large cars and concern about financial conditions in new york city were blamed for keeping customers away from the auto showrooms the president of a new jersey trade association likewise categorized automobile sales in northern new jersey as weak although dealers throughout the country are experiencing difficulty in moving small cars this problem is even more pronounced in new jerseyinventories generally appeared to be at desired levels although plans to restock inventories were reported by some respondents the vice president of a large petroleum company stated that oil inventories which had been depleted by the cold weather were rising to planned levels and that no inventory problems were expected before the next heating season retailers have been keeping a close watch on inventories which has kept them in line with sales in the paper industry inventories had been allowed to run down since mid1976 according to a top executive of a paper company but some rebuilding is now anticipated an economist for a large publishing firm stated that he expects inventory accumulation to occur throughout the yearcapital spending in the second district as in the nation has recovered slowly although conditions may be improving the chairman of a major oil company observed that due to confusing regulations in the oil industry it is not profitable to build plants today he further stated that unless controls are eliminated a shortage of refinery capacity will develop in the early l980s the view that government regulations inhibit capital spending was echoed by an executive of a major commercial bank in the same vein the director of finance for a private utility company complained that because of delays caused by environmental regulations the time required for constructing a nuclear plant has been lengthened from six years to ten years the vice president of an iron and steel company attributed the sluggishness in plant and equipment spending to insufficient financial capital and in the rubber industry a spokesman for a trade association stated that the industry is reluctant to add further to its already heavy debt burden on the brighter side a textile industry economist reported that capital spending long lackluster has recently shown signs of turning up in response to improved demand conditions moreover the buffalo directors reported favorable nearterm prospects for capital goods orders as well as for production and employment this was especially true for the steel industry in western new york which is experiencing new demand by canadian customers as well as strong demand by the automobile industryconcern over the outlook for prices was voiced by many respondents the production manager of a machinery company reported widespread increases in the cost of materials and fabricated inputs he also expressed his belief that the effects of recent increases in the price of steel would continue to ripple through the economy while most businessmen were reporting higher materials prices the president of a major capital goodsproducing company stated that despite increases in list prices of steel and various other materials actual prices paid by his company were about the same as a year ago with the notable exception of aluminum an economist for a paper company said he expects upward pressure on prices as businesses try to rebuild their profit margins after the cost increases of the past year oil prices are expected to continue rising as the import share grows in the consumer goods sector the editor of an industry publication reported a round of wholesale price increases in february and march that are expected to show up in the form of higher retail price tags in late summer and early fall
1063,1063,5-10-1977,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,economic activity in the second district continues to improve moderately according to directors businessmen and economists recently contacted the quickening pace of the national economy was largely expected by respondents and thus necessitated few revisions in the economic outlook several contacts anticipate that inventory positions in various industries will be moderately built up in the months ahead the outlook for capital spending remains mixed at least at this point it appears that the administrations energy proposals while adding to planning uncertainties are unlikely to have a substantive nearterm impact on capital spending on the price scene there was widespread concern that the rate of inflation was intensifyingdepartment store sales in the new york metropolitan area appear to have increased at a moderate pace though apparently less rapidly than in the nation as a whole respondents pointed to some evidence that new york city stores have been registering greater gains than their suburban counterparts thereby reversing a longterm trend the prospects for department store sales during the second quarter are generally considered good merchants are even more sanguine over widening profit margins because of cautious tailoring of inventories to sales thus they do not expect the substantial and widespread price markdowns created a year ago by burdensome inventoriesdistrict auto dealers have also become more optimistic in recent weeks while the president of a trade association said that sales in the new york metropolitan area were slow he attributed this to adverse publicity of one manufacturer interchanging engines and considered that the effect would be shortlived the brightening sales prospects were also shared by an official of a new jersey trade association reporting that sales had recently improved he looks for fairly good sales for the remainder of the year the presidents energy proposals were not expected to adversely affect auto sales one respondent stated that most new cars were already meeting the proposed milespergallon standardwith regard to the nation as a whole several district economists anticipate that inventory investment will strengthen in the months ahead by and large inventories appear to be at desired levels locally however an economist at one large chemical manufacturer expects inventory rebuilding due to a recent pickup in sales the vice president of a capital goods firm reported that production is being stepped up because of rising shipments and low inventories a spokesman for a steel manufacturer in western new york said he expects his firm to be reducing inventories to meet liquidity needs but anticipates that steel customers will continue building inventoriesthe outlook for plant and equipment expenditures remains mixed the president of a major metals producer noted little likelihood of a pickup in capital spending especially in basic industries on the other hand a capital goods executive stated that its orders and shipments had just reached a record high the president of a major new york city bank reported mixed signals from his customers some firms appear to be holding back on capital spending while others most notably automobiles are going ahead with increased outlayswith regard to the presidents proposed energy program most respondents felt that there were so many uncertainties to be resolved that its impact on capital expenditures could not be determined at this time utility executives indicated that their spending plans would be unaffected in the near term all planned projects are in keeping with the presidents goalsinvolving either the installation of nuclear plants or the conversion of existing facilities to coal some of the utilities foresee possible additional expenditures if they are forced by the final legislation to convert their remaining oilburning facilities to some other fuel the chief economist of a petroleum firm stated that domestic profit margins were generally not high enough to warrant new investment due to governmental regulations most respondents viewed the carter energy program as incomplete failing to provide incentives for increasing the supply of energycontinuing inflation remains a dominant concern of respondents although none foresaw any immediate danger of a return to doubledigit rates apprehensions were expressed by a larger number of contacts most felt that some upward pressure on prices would result if the energy proposals were enacted but not a substantial amount cost factors were cited by an industry spokesman as the reason for a probable nearterm rise in steel prices and an economist with a food company anticipates further increases in food prices this year however a spokesman from the metals industry expects no substantial rise in metals prices soon stating that market factors prevented his firm from fully passing on increased costs
1075,1075,6-15-1977,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the second district economy continues to expand at a moderate pace according to recent reports from directors business leaders and economists residential construction activity appears to be picking up but respondents reported no evidence of speculative excesses retail sales continue to post solid gains and inventories appeared to be at satisfactory levels while many directors voiced concern that the uncertainty created by the proposed energy program would delay capital outlays district industrialists report few revisions in spending plans employment growth remains sluggish but directors heralded a step toward an improved business climate offered by a ruling against payment of unemployment insurance benefits to strikersseveral respondents noted a recent improvement in residential construction activity in the second district the president of a leading new jersey bank stated that the demand for residential mortgages was the strongest in more than five years the president of a major telephone utility reported phone sales were running at rates much higher than anticipated for the most part the strength appears concentrated in single family and lowrise condominiums construction of new apartment houses in this area continues to lag boding well for continued regional growth none of the respondents including the directors of the head office and buffalo branch saw any indication of the speculative fever reported on the west coast one banker noted that new york city apartment prices have improved tremendously in recent months but there is nothing speculative about thatretail sales have shown further gains in the new york metropolitan area an executive of one national chain reported a much brisker pace here than in the country as a whole for the third consecutive month sales gains at several large new york city stores outpaced gains at suburban counterparts the president of one major department store attributed much of his s improvement to a recent largescale refurbishing of its new york city site the increase in retail inventories generally was viewed as accompanying the rise in sales merchants felt sales prospects remained brightmost businesses remain cautious about inventory levels expanding stocks only in response to gains in sales one business economist noted that inventory building was quite low for this stage of an economic recovery overall inventories appeared to be in good balance with sales while some respondents reported inventories were somewhat below desired levels most firms felt inventories were at generally satisfactory levels a vicepresident of a large capital goods producing firm which had been facing sluggish demand reported that with a good flow of new orders his firm could establish a satisfactory level without having to curtail production the languishing demand for structural steel prompted one steel producer to close one of its older less efficient plants in western new york steel inventories were somewhat higher than desired due in part to lessthananticipated hedge buying by customers prior to the midjune steel price risethe regional employment picture shows little near term improvement in addition to the steel plant closing a major automobile manufacturer announced a substantial reduction of new york city personnel more positively the buffalo branch and head office directors cited the ruling against the payment of unemployment benefits to strikers in new york as a step toward reestablishing a healthy business climate it was expected that employment costs would only be marginally reduced but the general impact toward improving new york states competitive position will be considerable thus while it would be unlikely to bring in new industry the motivation to leave should be reduced one buffalo director felt it might lead firms to reconsider or alter decisions not to expand new york facilitiesregarding the impact on capital spending of the presidents energy program opinions were mixed spokesmen from industrial companies stated that their current plans were unaffected either because they comply with the proposal or are firmly fixed on the other hand the chairman of a major new york city bank felt that on balance the program appeared to be having a negative effect on capital spending the chairman of an international oil company said it could result in lower investment by the petroleum industry several economists and directors believe that longer term capital spending is likely to be temporarily postponed until the uncertainty concerning the final program is resolved on the general outlook for capital spending one director noted that sharp increases in costs have clearly had a major impact on capital spending and may keep the rise in spending down even through 1978 capital appropriations have been high but followup in terms of spending may be slow since many businesses do not think they can pass on higher costs in terms of product pricesin the financial area there are some indications that loan demand is increasing in selected parts of the district one of the directors noted a quickening of demand in upstate new york while another reported that business loans were up in the central part of the state a banking director from new jersey noted that while overall loan demand was still lagging home improvement and installment loans were strong business loan demand in new york city shows little growth
1092,1092,7-13-1977,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,economic activity in the second district continues to gain according to reports from directors and other business leaders contacted recently while department store sales slackened in june demand for consumer durable goods remained strong and merchants view the outlook as favorable real estate and residential construction activity have posted solid gains and inventories of unsold homes are in good balance with sales capital spending plans in the second district appear to be slowly gaining momentum respondents apparently discount the possibility that wageprice controls will be reimposed in the foreseeable future current labor supplies are adequate for the most part but a few shortages of skilled labor have emergeddepartment store sales were described as sluggish in june the chairman of a large apparel company characterized sales in the first part of june as the worst in three months another retailing executive attributed the sluggishness of sales to the warm weather in may which had encouraged purchases of seasonal apparel that would normally have taken place in june for the most part it appears that the slowdown was concentrated in nondurable goods despite this softening all of the retail executives contacted were optimistic about the outlook for merchandising one retailer emphasized that care would be required in interpreting july retail sales data he pointed out that july is traditionally marked by clearance campaigns and sales are thus more likely indicative of the size of markdowns required to move unsold goods than of underlying demandoutside of department stores strong demand for consumer products was reported by several respondents a supplier of electrical components to the appliance industry reported shipments running well ahead of the nearrecord pace of the previous year in addition a major producer of components for writing instruments was experiencing excellent sales and was operating at full capacitythe continued improvement of the regional economy was also reflected in a pickup of real estate activity and residential construction according to the president of a real estate management company demand for manhattan real estate has been recovering impressively blocks of prime rental space are now scarce with the large vacancies concentrated in secondary or less desirable buildings in new jersey the president of a large mortgage banking firm held a sanguine assessment of the outlook for singlefamily construction in his judgment while housing prices are high financing costs are being met through the contribution of working wives andor moonlighting on the part of breadwinners barring an unforeseen tightening in credit deferred demand remains unsatisfied and construction activity is expected to continue to advance furthermore builders concerns about inflation appear to be waning so that cost escalators are no longer being built into sales contractsbusinessmen continue to keep a close watch on inventories as a consequence inventories generally remain in good balance with sales petroleum inventories which experienced a sharp rundown last winter have returned to normal levels and were reported to be well above the level of a year ago the chairman of an international oil company felt that summer gasoline prices could weaken as a result reports from the chemical industry suggest that inventories are satisfactorycapital spending appears to be slowly gaining momentum on the negative side the president of a major life insurance company reported that businessmen are hesitant to increase their capital spending plans because the outlook for profits remains uncertain more positively a major automotive producer has a 22 million plant under construction in the rochester area elsewhere in western new york capital spending by industry was described as moderate reporting on the agricultural sector in upstate new york one director indicated that investment in both fixed assets and equipment was exceptionally strong in new jersey a manufacturer of plastic products is planning nearrecord outlays on machine tools in order to meet robust demandcontributing to the positive outlook directors and businessmen generally did not expect a reimposition of formal wage and price controls one industrial economist felt that the appointment of mr barry bosworth as director of the council on wage and price stability as suggestive of some greater attempts to keep the lid on prices however this respondent expected these to be more in the form of jawboning than actual controls in the view of the chairman of a major new york city bank an informal program of price controls already appeared to be in effect he expects to see a reaction by the administration to large price increases similar to the reaction to recent increases in bank prime rateswhile labor supplies were considered adequate overall some shortages of certain skills were noted by respondents in the upstate area the buffalo directors reported a slight shortage of skilled workersmost notably qualified draftsmen and engineers a manufacturer of plastic products reported that production was limited somewhat by an inadequate supply of skilled toolmakers and mold designers
1104,1104,8-10-1977,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,recent comments of directors and other business leaders in the second district indicate a continuation of moderate expansion of business activity at the same time responses reveal anxieties over the outlook for trends in employee compensation and in profitability of business enterprise among notable current developments activity in the real estate sector has quickened considerably and at least a modest revival of construction activity appears to be under way consumer spending has been fairly strong despite a stifling heat wave and the loss of one business day due to a blackout in the new york city area nevertheless mounting inventories have become a problem for some businesses several respondents also voiced concern over an apparent stiffening of wage demands and increasing pressures on profit margins on the financial scene the continuing lag in business loan demand in new york city has prompted several major banks to consider measures to seek out mediumsized regional customersin spite of the forced closing of stores in the new york city area by the loss of electrical service in midjuly department store sales generally strengthened last month in the view of the leading retailers contacted merchants generally recouped lost sales upon reopening indeed one retailer reported the sales at its city branches continued to outperform its national stores among product lines apparel sales were strong merchants differed in interpreting this strength however some expected the steppedup activity to continue while others expected it to wane with the end of summer markdowns and promotions sales of other consumer products also rose strongly in july pacing the gain in consumer durables were sales of air conditioners and fans which swelled in the wake of the heat wave that gripped the districtrespondents generally reported that inventory levels were building up while some retailers professed little concern over this development in view of the favorable outlook for merchandising others were less sanguine one executive of a national retail chain indicated that all divisions had exceeded their budgets tying up more funds in inventories than was desired industrial respondents also reported increases in inventories for the most part inventory levels were not felt to be seriously out of line with shipments although some metal fabricators did regard their stocks of raw materials as excessive a director noted other scattered instances of unwanted inventory buildupreports on capital spending were mixed on the one hand several upstate machine and tool makers found new orders increasing smartly one firm attributed the upward trend in orders to the strengthening of the automotive sector in western new york state in response to a pickup in demand one steel maker recently reactivated a blast furnace that had been closed since late last year oil well drilling activity has picked up and overall capital spending in the petroleum industry was expected to rise by 18 percent this year compared with an earlier planned increase of 12 percent notwithstanding these signs of strengthening demand several respondents cited a general sluggishness in shipments and orders an agricultural director reported that spending on farm implements and equipment was down due to weak farm pricestentative signs of a recovery in real estate and construction appear to be emerging recently plans were announced to develop a new office building in manhattan without a specific corporate tenant this represented the first major speculative project in several years and comes on the heels of recent reports of rising rents and of a scarcity of large blocks of desirable office space elsewhere in the district building activity appeared to be gaining momentum as well the buffalo branch reported that construction contracts in the niagara region have strengthened recently one branch director reported plans for a new shopping center on a plot that had been on the market for a number of years in his rural communityrespondents displayed varying degrees of pessimism over the outlook for profits one director noted that recent weeks have seen a softening in sales and prices of aluminumpreviously the one bright spot in the otherwise depressed nonferrous metals sector another director observed that some steel fabricators and users are likely to encounter trouble passing along recent steel price hikes to their customers part of the lackluster outlook for profits moreover reflected concern over the growth of labor costs several respondents perceived a stiffening in wage demands as well as increased union emphasis on fringe benefits and work rule concessions a director expected brass processors to take a tough stance in forthcoming labor negotiations because of poor business the chairman of a major bank foresaw wages at his bank rising by one percentage point faster than prices over the balance of the year a buffalo director felt that the increase in unemployment compensation benefits recently approved by the new york state legislature would add to the upward pressure on wage rates respondents also cited the high costs of energy and of pollution control as retarding the growth of profit marginsthe continued sluggishness of new york city business loan demand has apparently led several major banks to consider reorienting their marketing strategies toward mediumsized regional customers a few new york banks already haveoutofstate loan production offices and several others are actively contemplating the establishment of such offices the chairman of a major bank indicated that his bank had posted a good gain in its share of national lending during the seven weeks when its prime rate was one quarter percentage point below the generally prevailing level despite reports of price cutting below posted rates by some other banks in seeking business loans
1120,1120,9-14-1977,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity in the second district continues to expand moderately judging from recent comments of directors and other business leaders the expansion appears to be quickening in new york city but prospects for gains in activity in the western region of the district have been clouded by sizable planned cutbacks in steel production and employment for the district as a whole the pace of activity continues to lag the nation retail sales continue strong but the outlook for capital spending remains unclear inventory levels appear to be on the high side on the financial front business loan demand remains sluggish but many bankers look for a pickup in demand in coming monthsthe gains in retailing varied across the district department store sales in new york city continued to post solid gains in august according to leading city retailers the gains were bolstered by aggressive merchandising and major remodeling of several stores among product lines apparel sales recorded large gains as consumers appeared to step up purchases of fall fashions and backtoschool clothing sales of consumer durables most notably fans and air conditioners were cited as remaining strong upstate sales appeared to be less robust the president of a major department store in rochester reported sales were somewhat below expectationsthe announcement of production cutbacks by a major steel producer represents a severe blow to the sluggish recovery of western new york within the next few months the firm plans to cut steelmaking capacity in its niagara frontier facility by some 40 percent from 48 million tons annually to 28 million tons four blast furnaces one basic oxygen furnace and three rolling mills will be closed some 3500 employees accounting for 30 percent of the firms payroll in the area will be laid off in addition to this direct loss observers expect employment in related industriesmost notably trucking and railroadsto be affected adverselyaccording to a steel executive the problems plaguing its niagara frontier production facility were age and inefficiency a commercial bank economist noted that these problems are not unique to steel in this economists view upstate capital goods producers in general are saddled with older less efficient plants given the sizable tax disadvantages of operating in new york many firms are hesitant to reinvest and many simply transfer operations out of the state reflecting the continuation of these trends several major manufacturers recently announced such actionsinventory stocks appear to be high at the retail level some executives reported little concern with the higher level of inventories because of optimistic sales prospects other retailers however were wary of the higher stocks the chairman of a major new york city bank reported some specific situations where inventories were getting a little out of hand but felt there was no widespread problem in this vein several directors pointed out inventory excesses in the metals industries due to lowerthananticipated orders and shipments a chemical executive reported inventory imbalances in certain chemical and textile products and expected production curtailments in coming months to bring stocks into line with sales the directors of the buffalo branch agreed that continued tight inventory policies would prevent any excesses from becoming widespreadnotwithstanding the upward revisions in the government survey of 1977 planned investment outlays directors of the buffalo branch reported that businessmen continue to make capital spending decisions in a very conservative even cautious light on the outlook for 1978 respondents offered little hope for a quickening in the pace of spending the economist of a major chemical producer reported that his firm had cut 1978 planned spending by 25 percent compared with 1977 several directors reported that the slack conditions in the ferrous and nonferrous metals industries augured for cutbacks in spending in these industries a director of thebuffalo branch felt that the leveling off in gasoline consumption accounted for the apparent slack in investment in refinery capacity the chief economist of a major automobile manufacturer expects his firms 1978 spending to hold at the record level planned for this year for the automobile industry as a whole he felt capital outlays could be strong due to outlays required on tools and equipment associated with resizing automobile productionapart from a recent spurt in bankers acceptances the demand for business loans in the district on balance has remained sluggish both in and outside new york city and generally below earlier expectations however a number of loan officers at large commercial banks throughout the district looked for some pickup over the coming months several bankers noted a strengthening in automobile loans no significant change in time and savings deposit flows at district commercial banks was evident in recent weeks there was a moderate net outflow in august at new york state savings banks which according to a savings bank association official was probably seasonal as well as reflecting some runoff of wild cards
1136,1136,10-11-1977,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity across the second district is somewhat mixed according to directors and other business leaders contacted recently while the consumer sector appears to be relatively strong inventory levels remain on the high side and the outlook for capital spending is mixed with little indication of a significant stepup of planned plant and equipment outlays concerns over the prospective rate of recovery of the districts western region due to the large cutbacks by the steel industry appear to have been intensified by sizable harvest losses caused by adverse weather on the financial front the sluggishness in business loan demand persistsretail sales increased moderately in september in the wake of an exceptionally strong august gain several department store executives expressed satisfaction with the sales activity in the new york and new jersey branches among product lines both household furnishings and womens apparel appear to have maintained strength although in the latter instance some resistance to this seasons higher prices was noted by several merchants the controller of a major chain credited sunday store openings with helping to improve sales activity in new york he noted that since sunday openings were legalized a year ago these sales have accounted for an increasing proportion of total sales in general merchants as well as executives of other consumerrelated businesses expected favorable sales developments in coming months based on strong inflow of orders the chairman of a national manufacturer of photo equipment reported that the consumer sales outlook appeared good brightening sales prospects were also suggested by telephone and newspaper executives who reported strong pickups in retail advertisingarea auto dealers reported good sales in september a rebound in the used car market led the advance apparently as fears over prospective energy legislation dissipated new car sales were characterized as strong although several respondents expressed concern over the effect the higher prices on new models will have on sales in coming monthsinventories remained on the high side in the retail sector most executives professed little concern over high levels of stocks judging them not to be unreasonably out of line with sales prospects for the fall and christmas seasons outside of retailing respondents were generally less sanguine in assessing their inventory positions a textiles executive expressed concern that excessive inventories were accumulating in his industry several respondents in the chemical and petrochemical industries reported higherthandesired stocks the treasurer of a major nonferrous metals company reported a similar backing up of inventories although at least part of the stockpiling had been in anticipation of aluminum price increasescapital spending plans for 1978 remain mixed while responses varied among industries and firms several directors foresaw expenditures for next year to be on a level approximately equal to that in 1977 at one extreme plant and equipment spending by the steel industry is being curtailed sharply capital spending by farmers in western new york state is also likely to be reduced because of the heavy crop losses they suffered due to the past months unusually heavy rainfall several machine tool manufacturers related that as a consequence of weakness in new orders and bookings they will limit their new capital investment the president of one large chemical company reported that due to overcapacity his firms spending would be shifted to maintenance and conservation rather than expansion while the chairman of another chemical company felt the instability in the economy was undermining the growth of capital spending several other business leaders across new york state indicated that they had no plans to expand production facilities during the coming year in addition to uncertainty over the outlook for demand a leading apparel executive also cited the high cost of raising funds as a reason for lagging capital investment in his industry at the other extreme one major nonferrous metal fabrication firm has greatly increased its capital outlays in upstate new york due in part to substantial improvement in its cash position the chairman of a major petroleum company also expected his industry to continue its relatively high rate of capital spendingwith few exceptions business loan demand at second district banks has remained sluggish moreover the leading bankers contacted did not expect any substantial pickup in the near term because of the strong liquidity position of potential borrowers several financial analysts attributed at least some of the weakness in loan demand at commercial banks to increased competition of commercial finance companies in servicing the credit needs of small and mediumsized businesses in other banking developments upstate directors noted that individual savings show steady growth and that installment lending continues at a high level and the president of a leading new jersey bank reported that mortgage loan demand has risen sharply in his area
1152,1152,11-9-1977,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,activity in the second district continues to be mixed and lagging behind that of the rest of the nation according to recent comments of directors and other business leaders on the national outlook respondents were generally encouraged by prospects of continued economic expansion although many appeared concerned that the uncertainties of prospective tax and energy legislation will inhibit capital spending within the district retail activity posted a moderate gain in october but inventory levels remained on the high side harvest losses caused by heavy rains in the western region of the district are expected to exceed 150 million containerized port activity remains at a standstill as the dock strike enters its second monthdepartment store sales in october apparently met merchants expectations several leading retailers reported that sales were very strong during the first half of the month but subsequently waned for the most part retailing executives attributed the slackening in activity to unseasonably warm weather which curtailed purchases of outerwear one leading merchant suggested that part of the slowdown could be the lack of a spillover of preelection day sales activity into october several respondents indicated that sales gains lagged the rest of the nation despite the softening the department store executives looked to the approaching christmas season with cautious optimismoutside of department stores consumer spending on new cars appeared more robust although here too the pace appeared to lag the nation a director of a major automobile finance company held a sanguine assessment of automobile sales professing no concern over consumer indebtedness or delinquency rates several major auto dealers reported that sales in october were on target but lagging national sales the higher prices of new models apparently met with little sales resistancealthough some inventory imbalances were reported they did not appear to be widespread nor unduly burdensome in the retail sector the slowdown in sales did apparently lead to some buildup in inventories one retailing chain executive attributed his firm s increase in stocks to overordering by store managers none of the retailers contacted felt their stocks to be seriously out of line with plans especially in view of the approaching christmas season in the industrial sector a chemical executive expected the industrys inventory excesses to be worked off by the end of the year for the most part respondents felt that businesses tight inventory policies prevented any serious or widespread involuntary accumulationpervasive uncertainty over government policies was frequently blamed for inhibiting capital spending by business several directors reported that firms were awaiting clarification of the outlook on tax legislation before framing their capital spending plans more generally uncertainty surrounding a broad range of government policies was cited by the chairman of a major new york city bank one director voiced apprehension over energy and environmental policies as retarding plant and equipment outlays the president of a major chemical firm mentioned the uncertainty associated with the proposed social security legislation the president of a major new jersey bank felt that local business in his area seemed to be more caught up with local environmental and tax issues than with national policies in a similar vein the buffalo directors expressed concern over the high tax burdens in new york state that tend to limit spending on capital improvements of existing plants on a positive note one buffalo director reported some acceleration in capital spending plans among small to mediumsized firms due to special tax incentives offered by the state for jobcreating capital infusionsthere is a good deal of concern over the farm crop in central and western new york state heavy rain from the middle of september through october seriously damaged the crops and left the ground too wet to harvest surviving crops by the customary mechanical means dairy farmers also are suffering as they are unable to harvest the feed for their herds crop damage in the thirtyfive upstate counties is expected to exceed 150 millionanother negative factor weighing on the regional economy is the limited dock strike which appears to be having an increasing impact as it enters its second month according to an executive of a leading maritime firm there are currently 16 to 20 fully loaded ships tied up in the port of new york there appears little hope for an immediate settlement though there are some indications that one many be reached before thanksgiving the lengthy strike is expected to produce serious difficulties for retailers who offer significant quantities of imported merchandise for christmas sale and could spark some upward price pressures the continuation of the strike also has serious repercussions on puerto rico because of the commonwealths heavy reliance on imported goods
1168,1168,12-14-1977,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the pace of economic activity in the second district continues to expand moderately according to directors and other business leaders who were contacted recently retailers are optimistic about holiday merchandising as department store sales quickened in early december after some sluggishness early in the season retail inventories remain on the high side though containerized port activity rebounded with the settlement of the dock strike but district employment continues to grow only slowly on the financial front the persistent sluggishness in business loan demand appears to have prompted some new york city banks to take aggressive measures to encourage borrowingdepartment store sales strengthened in early december and district merchants are optimistic about christmassales prospects according to leading retailers sales slowed in late november but posted sizable gains in early december several department store executives attributed the softening in late november to the unseasonably warm weather that followed thanksgiving as a result of the subsequent pickup in consumer purchases most merchants expected a strong christmas buying season in new york city retailers assessments of the outlook ranged from very optimistic to pretty good directors of the buffalo branch reported that despite the large layoffs by the steel industry the sales experience in western new york suggested a very strong holiday merchandising season for the most part retailers reports on inventories suggested that stocks were high respondents emphasized that inventory positions are extremely difficult to assess at this time since so much depends on the strength of sales for the remainder of the holiday season one respondent nevertheless felt that price markdowns would be required to bring stocks down to satisfactory levels reports on new car sales suggested that the district developments reflected national conditions area auto dealers reported an unexpected dropoff in new car sales in november as a result auto inventories were characterized as very highin the industrial sector comments of district business leaders continue to paint a mixed picture according to the buffalo branch directors orders for industrial goods in upstate new york appear to be holding steady more positively the chief economist of a major paper firm noted a significant pickup in paper orders for the most part district industrialists reported ample unused capacity and had few plans to step up capital spending in 1978 most expenditures appear to be aimed at replacing or modernizing existing plant and equipment and few new capacity additions seem planned one exception appears to be the petroleum industry the economist of a major oil corporation stated that his firm planned large expenditures and that drilling activity for the industry as a whole was at a sixteenyear highconstruction activity appears to be gaining some momentum but continues to lag behind the nation several businessmen reported a pickup in residential construction activity in recent months nevertheless joblessness among building trades workers remains high indeed in order to encourage further construction activity a bricklayers union in new york city has accepted more than a ten percent cut in wage rates for specific types of jobspart of the general gloom of the regions sluggish employment picture has been dispelled by the settlement of the dock workers strike in the wake of the settlement employment and port activity rebounded as shippers attempted to move the backlog of imported merchandise to distributors and retailers but some depressants to the district business climate remain cutbacks in steel production are continuing in the western region of the district also in new york state an appeals court ruling overturned a lower court decision that had declared unconstitutional the payment of unemployment benefits to strikersbusiness loan demand continues to lag in the district partly as a consequence one major new york city bank has introduced a new lending facility to accommodate commercial paper borrowers the program involves very shortterm lending at terms only slightly above the federal funds rate the facility is designed to provide borrowers a temporary alternative when paper financing is either relatively unattractive or not feasible according to a senior lending officer of the bank only a few dozen borrowers have used the facility in its initial month of operation but other potential users appear to be interested at least one competing bank has reportedly responded by matching this lending rate because of the pervasive sluggishness of lending demands a few banks are reportedly foregoing compensating balance requirements on a highly selective basis on loans to prime customers or lending at somewhat below the prime rate outside of new york city loan demand appears flat in western new york and buffalo directors report no visible prospect for a turnaround in the near term
1184,1184,1-11-1978,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity remains mixed in the second district according to directors and business leaders but the outlook is viewed more favorably than in recent months retailers throughout the region apparently experienced an excellent holiday season and their inventories are now judged at satisfactory levels although some hesitation followed settlement of the twomonth selective dock strike the outlook for shipping is now characterized as strong there are also some scattered reports of increases in capital spending in the district domestic auto sales remain depressed however although some dealers are optimistic that activity could strengthen considerably in the springvirtually all major retailers contacted in the second district were elated over the strength of buying during the holiday season sales at the major department stores apparently at least matched or in some cases far exceeded expectations which had already been high new york city sales were especially strong with some outlets claiming their best holiday performance in at least several years while some retailers reported a large amount of discounting and promotional activity few indicated that this was more than normal for the periodinformation on postholiday sales is sketchy and conflicting some respondents reported that sales were holding up very well in early january while others talked of a postholiday slump in any case all retailers contacted indicated that inventories were now on target or only slightly above target none viewed their inventories as a problem given the volume of business they experienced in decemberwhile department store sales have been strong in the district according to most respondents sales of domestically produced autos continue to be depressed dealers report that inventories are not moving because of price resistance and dissatisfaction with the new models however there appears to be growing optimism among dealers that this is simply a question of deferred buying since a spring upturn is common when there has been a slow winterby contrast foreign auto sales have been very strong substantially above last years level and ahead of all projections a spokesman for dealers of a major foreign compact reported that since the introduction of the 1978 models inventories have been insufficient to meet demand and there has been a backlog of orders although there has been a sharp increase in price largely as a result of the depreciation of the dollar there is no evidence of any price resistance as of yet instead customers apparently intend to hold their newly purchased autos for a longer period of time as they are buying more expensive options these dealers believe former large car owners are switching to smaller cars but prefer the proven quality of the foreign models to the unknown performance of the new domestic small modelsin other sectors of the district economy respondents also continue to paint a rather mixed picture a buffalo director indicated that the outlook for the chemical equipment industry is not good the situation in the power equipment industry however appears brighter due to the general need for more power plants but the long time frame for such construction makes specific predictions difficulta spokesman for a metals producer in the district reports that their copper and brass business is still strong this is expected to continue for the next two months and reflects in part strikes at competitors although aluminum mill production has been good demand for ingots is spotty demand for consumer metal products on the other hand is expected to continue to be strong through springa spokesman for an upstate forge reports a mild increase in orders he expects a steady level of orders through the first half of the year with most as replacement orders rather than net investment with no expectations of bottlenecks in production capacity or shortages in labor or materials he believes 1978 will be a good yearthe new york telephone company is projecting an increase in volume above last years rise according to one of the directors he also indicated that the telephone company is planning to increase expenditures on new construction by approximately 10 percent over the 1977 level another director reported a substantial increase in capital spending plans by other companies in the second district for 1978contrary to initial impressions the shipping industry in the second district did not rebound immediately following settlement of the selective dock strike at the beginning of december however an executive with a leading steamship company reports that business now looks good and that his outlook for 1978 is very optimistic
1197,1197,2-21-1978,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity in the second district has lost some momentum according to recent accounts of directors and other business leaders in the face of adverse weather retail sales in the region apparently softened in january and early february while the slackening in sales was unexpected most merchants were not alarmed by the rise in inventory stocks anticipating consumer spending to pick up with an easing in climatic conditions outside of retailing capital goods production remains sluggish overall the recovery in the regional economy continues to lag behind the economic expansion of the nation but much of the weakness appears concentrated in new york city revised labor force data now indicate a widening in the gap between the citys rate of joblessness and that of the rest of the nation on the financial scene senior thrift officers reported that weak or negative savings flows have had little effect on mortgage lendingconsumer spending in this district appeared to slow in january and early february in new york city department store executives were particularly disappointed in the sluggish pace of buying several national retailers indicated that sales in the new york metropolitan area and the east coast in general lagged well behind the rest of the country for the most part the slowdown was largely attributed to the adverse weather conditions in upstate new york merchandising was also sluggish with sales reportedly falling well short of anticipated volumes the buffalo directors were less sanguine about the outlook than downstate merchants voicing concern over a possible shift in consumer sentiment as well as a lagged response to the retrenchment of the steel industry notwithstanding the overall sluggishness of sales in the district rochester area retailers reported brisk postholiday demand for both durable and nondurable goodswhile the unanticipated softening in sales activity has resulted in somewhat higherthandesired inventory stocks most retailers did not appear overly concerned for the most part merchants appear to believe that underlying consumer sentiment is strong and that as weather conditions improve buying activity will pick up in any case inventory policies remain cautious outside of the retail sector inventories were generally viewed as in balance with salescapital goods production in the district appears to be sluggish several industrialists in upstate new york report orders for new capital goods are only slightly higher than a year ago at least thus far the curtailment of steel production in the buffalo area appears to have had no significant effects on major suppliers the buffalo branch directors characterized capital spending prospects over the next several months as lethargic most respondents expected little relief from the administrations tax proposals which were viewed largely as an offset to the prospective hike in social insurance taxes in contrast to this general view one upstate machine and tool manufacturer expected a good year with only the potential weakness in the automobile industry possibly troublesomewith the improvement in the regional economy lagging behind that of the nation area unemployment rates remain well above the national level moreover as a result of recent revisions in the calculation of joblessness the unemployment rate in new york city was revised up to 105 percent in january some two percentage points higher than it would have been under the earlier procedure over the past year the new york city joblessness rate has fallen about half a percentage point less than half the drop registered for the nation as a whole while the upstate region has fared much better the state as a whole posted a 79 percent rate of joblessness in januaryon the financial front the rise in market interest rates has finally begun to have a significant effect on thrift deposit flows in the area senior officers at new york city thrift institutions reported weak or negative net new savings flows in january in upstate new york and new jersey deposit flows were somewhat stronger although still below the levels of a year ago all new york city respondents expect continued weakness in deposit growth for the rest of 1978 while upstate institutions anticipate some slowdown relative to 1977 but less weakness than in new york city however few respondents reported actual or expected tightening in lending requirements for residential mortgage loans in new york due in large measure to the 8 12 percent usury ceiling which has already raised nonprice terms of residential mortgage lending the executive vice president of a major new jersey savings bank expected some tightening in commercial and residential lending none of the respondents expected to liquidate selfinitiated whole mortgages during 1978 in order to raise funds moderate disintermediation was expected to be met through selling securities from their portfolios many respondents echoed the concern of the president of one of new yorks largest savings banks that a further rise in interest rates would pose a serious threat of substantial disintermediation
1210,1210,3-15-1978,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity in the second district has still not fully recovered the momentum it lost earlier in the year when the harsh winter weather beset the region according to recent accounts of directors and other business leaders retailers reported that while their sales had picked up in february and early march adverse weather continued to act as an impediment retail inventory stocks are regarded as being a bit on the high side but merchants foresee a strong spring season and plan to run down their excess stocks then meanwhile the coal strike does not seem to have had much effect on production in the district but businessmen doubt that this immunity will continue if the strike lasts very much longer on the financial side although business loan demand has remained sluggish at large banks in the district some see a modest strengthening in the coming monthsconsumer spending in the district appears to be shaking off its winter doldrums downstate merchants reported a pickup in their sales in february and early march following the abrupt downturn in january they generally felt moreover that the gains would have been even bigger if there had been more of a letup in the weather elsewhere in the district retail sales appear to have been fairly flat though signs of an increase in consumer durable purchases were reported in the buffalo area throughout the district however retailers remain confident and look forward to a strong spring seasoninventory stocks at retail establishments are reportedly running on the high side a director of this bank suggested that the high inventories were due in part to the prevailing optimism regarding the sales outlook indeed many retailers did mention that they are expecting strong retail sales in the spring and that this turnover will bring their inventory stocks into balance with sales furthermore among the merchants who were queried none expressed concern about excess inventories outside of the retailing sector inventories were viewed as in line with salesamong those people who were contacted few felt that their business operations had been hampered thus far by the coal strike one business economist who monitors the national economy thought that the strike was having harmful effects nationwide but neither he nor anybody else mentioned specific harmful effects that the strike had had on businesses located in the second district at the same time it was generally agreed that a prolongation of the coal strike would soon begin to constrict business activity in the regionresponses to the midfebruary quarterly survey of bank lending practices suggest that business loan demand in the second district was weaker than anticipated in the midnovember survey although nine of the 16 reporting large banks had expected moderate strengthening only five respondents indicated such gains while one reported much stronger demand the remaining ten banks reported the strength of loan demand as unchanged since midnovember data for large weekly reporting banks in the second district generally indicate a flat picture of loan demand with seasonally unadjusted commercial and industrial loans excluding bankers acceptances rising by 14 million to 37248 million from november 16 1977 to february 15 1978 at new york city large weekly reporters the comparable change was a decline of 171 million to 32048 million seasonally adjusted data for these new york city banks show an increase of 54 million to 32177 million in commercial and industrial loans between november 16 and february 15in spite of weaker than anticipated loan demand reported in midfebruary half of the surveyed banks expected moderately stronger loan demand in the three months ending in midmay however six of the respondents anticipated no change in loan demand while the remaining two expected demand to be moderately weaker
1222,1222,4-12-1978,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity in the second district has largely recovered from the winter doldrums and is expected to grow at a modest pace in coming months according to recent accounts of directors and other business leaders retailers reported their sales had risen sharply in recent weeks rebounding from the lackluster performance of the first two months of the year while most merchants are looking forward to gains in the months ahead they generally expect these increases will be of moderate proportions auto dealers too have lately experienced an upsurge in new car sales but much of the rise is believed to be a bulge due to deferred purchases while retail inventory stocks still seem to be on the high side merchants do seem to have managed to whittle down these excesses more or less according to plan outside of retailing the other sectors of the regional economy seem to be improving inventory stocks are lean inventory spending remains cautious and new orders for durable manufactured goods are expanding at a fairly brisk pace on the financial scene business loans at large new york city banks continue to be sluggishconsumer spending in the district strengthened appreciably in march and early april in new york city department store executives reported substantial gains in sales as compared with the depressed levels of january and february the improvement in retail activity was aided by the earlierthanusual easter holiday auto dealers also reported a substantial pickup in new car sales in recent weeks nevertheless none of the dealers sounded exuberant about the outlook for the rest of this modelyear apparently they would be satisfied if their car sales for 1978 were just to match those for last year in contrast the other retail merchants are more upbeat in their forecasts this will be as one retailer put it a good solid year but nothing dazzlingthe pickup in retail sales helped to trim inventory stocks at retail establishments earlier in the year merchants had said that they were counting on strong spring sales to enable them to pare their excess inventories to a large extent this has occurred although a few retailers are still saying their stocks are higher than they would like elsewhere in the regional economy inventory stocks appear to be lean in relation to sales the general feeling seems to be that inventories are either adequate or running a bit on the low side while there may be some rebuilding of inventories in coming months businesses do seem to be in a fairly cautious mood and are keeping a tight rein on their stocksin other sectors of the district economy the pace of business activity seems to have picked up in recent weeks indeed there are widespread reports of sizable gains in new orders for manufactured intermediate goodsranging from paper to forged iron and steel to machine tools this could be an advance indicator of a speedup in the recovery of the district economy it seems likely however that some part of these recent gains in orders is simply the result of the resumption of normal business patterns following the end of the prolonged coal strike and the unusually severe winter weather in any event the overall tenor of the responses suggests that the outlook for capital spending remains cautiousbusiness loan demand at large new york city banks has yet to show any sustained strength senior lending personnel at five large new york city banks were queried concerning the reasons for this phenomenon all five respondents emphasized the importance of corporate liquidity of large firms that have experienced strong cash flow and with fresh memories of credit stringency in 197374 have secured longterm financing unusually far ahead of anticipated needs looking at various competitive sources of funds there were mixed opinions as to the quantitative importance of eurodollar borrowing by large multinational customers one respondent cited heightened competition from the commercial paper market while two stated that they had not seen increased competition from that source lately there were also mixed perceptions of the importance of competition for large customers from regional banks with three respondents claiming more aggressive regional competition while two others did not rate it a very important factor among less publicized factors two respondents cited competition for term loans from insurance companies while another reported stiffer competition from finance companies all respondents indicated that an acceleration in capital spending would certainly help loan demand although they differed concerning the relative significance of this versus competitive and liquidity factors personnel at the two banks doing an appreciable amount of local business lending observed that loan demand by smaller second district customers was stronger than that of the large national firms
1239,1239,5-10-1978,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business conditions in the second district continue to improve according to the recent comments of directors and other business leaders at the same time the threat of worsening inflation remains a dominant concern many respondents are apprehensive that wage demands may stiffen in the wake of the coal miners settlement while the presidents expressed concern over the deteriorating price situation was applauded the substance of the proposed antiinflation program was questioned by many among notable developments at the regional level retail spending has been mixed lately new orders for durable goods are expanding and industrial inventories appear likely to grow on the financial scene business loan demands at large new york city banks continue to be sluggishthe sales experience of district retailers in april and early may was thoroughly mixed and generalizations are difficult to make appraisals of overall business ranged from exceptionally strong through fairly satisfactory to disappointing and in one case disastrous some merchants posted large gains in sales across virtually all product lines especially apparel home furnishings and appliances district automobile dealers also reported renewed strength in new car sales in some cases aggressive promotional activity was credited for the brisk sales but other merchants experienced reasonably strong demand in the absence of unusual promotional activity those retailers experiencing disappointing sales cited the early easter which had accelerated some seasonal buying into march and unseasonably cold weather since easter in general merchants were optimistic that warmer weather would stimulate sales of summer apparel while retail inventories appear to be a bit on the high side they are not terribly worrisomeoutside the retail sector district industrialists generally reported steady strengthening in business although the degree of strengthening varied somewhat several respondents noted a pickup in new orders in recent months the chairman of a major cable manufacturer reported business was well above projections on the other hand the treasurer of a capital equipment producer noted that while capital spending on mining and road construction was on the rise business spending showed little growth inventory stocks appears to be in good balance or perhaps even a little bit lean relative to shipmentsinflation remains a dominant concern among respondents several of the directors and business leaders contacted foresaw a worsening in the underlying rate of inflation these respondents were apprehensive that price pressures may intensify as a result of increased labor demands in the wake of the recent coal labor settlement other respondents saw no worsening in the fundamental rate of inflation a distinct minority of respondents felt that the coal settlement would have no material effect on negotiations in other industries for example the president of a large new york city utility called the bituminous coal situation unique and an upstate banker characterized the settlement as a traditional aberrationwith regard to the presidents antiinflation program respondents generally applauded the higher priority being attached to reducing inflation most respondents were skeptical of the longterm effectiveness of the program however indeed several noted that the presidents message could exacerbate the problem of inflation by encouraging large wage settlements and price increases in anticipation of stronger restrictions in the future a banker noted that the antiinflation program had been successful in defeating an inflationary farm billbusiness loan demand at major new york city banks continues to be sluggish senior lending officers at three leading banks reported particular weakness in shortterm lending due to underutilization of credit lines by major corporate customers these respondents attributed this weakness to the importance of corporate liquidity at large firms due to strong cash flows and the availability and attractive cost of issuing commercial paper one slight sign of increased demand in the future was cited by the chairman of a major bank who noted that there had been an increase in lending facilities although these facilities remained unused with respect to the eurodollar market respondents noted that the gradual increase in loans to nonbank foreignbased firms by overseas branches of u s banks may have diverted some loan demand from new york since 1973 much of the current business lending at new york banks appears to be taking the form of floatingrate term loans or equipment and workingcapital loans outside of new york city business loan demand appears to be increasing but according to some new jersey bankers it is not keeping pace with the increases in consumer installment loans reports of belowprime lending by some new york city banks continue to circulate and several bankers indicated that competition might soon force them to institute some type of superprime rate structure to keep their largest corporate customers

1266,1266,7-12-1978,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,comments of directors and other business leaders indicate that economic activity in the second district continues to expand moderately at the same time an increasing number of respondents voiced concern about prospects of a national slowdown or even a recession any downturn was expected to be relatively mild in large measure because of the absence of imbalances such as excessive inventories overbuilding or serious shortages of labor or supplies indeed although business conditions appear less buoyant recently than in the spring many of those canvassed gave upbeat reports for their own firms with a few noting a stepup in capital spending respondents unanimously viewed the recent increase in inventory investment as related to economic growth rather than hedge buying in anticipation of price rises leading new york city bankers expect some acceleration in loan demand over the remainder of the yeardistrict retail sales appear on balance to have posted a moderate advance in june and early july leading merchants in new york city characterized sales as not bad reasonably good or on target reports from upstate respondents indicated that sales were reasonably good merchants differed in assessing the outlook for consumer spending some viewed consumer sentiment as uncertain while others expected retail sales to exhibit continued strength at the same time several business economists expressed concern that mounting debt burdens would slow consumer spending the president of one of the districts leading retail firms discounted this view however noting that the amount of credit outstanding on a per account basis at his firm had risen only six percent over the past two yearsthe capital spending outlook appears mixed on the one hand several industriesmost notably the automotive and railroad sectorswere reported to be spending record amounts on capital investment producers of railroad cars are booked so solid that some firms are reportedly seeking foreign suppliers one director noted that one of the regions major airlines is operating close to capacity and is planning substantial capital commitments further evidence that capital spending has firmed was offered by a major producer of machine tools who reported continued strong orders and high backlogs on the less optimistic side a number of respondents reported no plans for stepping up capital spending several executives felt that government policies played a crucial role in inhibiting investment among the chief influences cited were the costs of pollution control programs whimsical changes in federal regulations uncertainty over the administrations economic policy and governments inability to control inflationthe level of inventories appears to be in relatively good balance with sales at the retail level most respondents seemed pleased with current inventory levels although a few viewed their stocks as slightly high recent inventory expansion was generally related to the strong economic growth posted in the second quarter uniformly no respondents reported hedge buying in anticipation of heightened inflation nevertheless inflation remains a primary concern of business executives most of the respondents felt that inflation was worsening and that rising prices would be a principal factor behind any economic slowdown at the same time many felt that the monetary authorities had done enough to fight inflation and that it was up to the government to curb prices by reducing fiscal stimulus for the most part respondents were skeptical as to the effectiveness of voluntary restraintsbusiness loans at the large banks in new york city were essentially flat during june following a strong performance in may looking to the future officers at four of five banks that were contacted foresaw some acceleration in loan demand in the second half of 1978 compared to the past six months however no one expected credit demands at anywhere near the rapid rates of expansion witnessed in the 197374 period in explaining the pickup in loan demand this year the most frequently mentioned causes were financing of mergers and acquisitions and inventories most respondents said that it was too soon to tell whether capital spending would provide much impetus to loan demand two respondents said new york city banks were finally picking up loans partly because of the growing inability of regional banks to further supply customer loan needs one respondent cited the rise in bond rates as at least temporarily stimulating demand for bank loans although the prime rate has risen 1 14 percentage points since the end of 1977 only one of the five respondents felt that it was having any deterrent effect on potential borrowers in fact one respondent cited fewer loans at below prime rates as evidence of a firming in loan demand although another respondent indicated that belowprime lending was still common
1280,1280,8-9-1978,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,recent comments of directors and other business leaders indicate that economic activity in the second district is continuing to grow at a moderate pace gains in retailing appear to be somewhat mixed but overall inventories are moderate outside of the consumer sector agricultural incomes are being bolstered by high prices and sizable harvests new orders for durable goods are strong although the outlook for capital expenditures remains cautious there is little evidence of any unusual tendency of firms to add work shifts rather than investing in new plant and equipment on the financial scene respondents voiced little concern over prospects of a liquidity squeeze at either financial or nonfinancial firms thrift deposit flows at large savings banks appear to be benefiting from the introduction of the new sixmonth certificatesgains in sales at major new york city department stores varied among respondents one department store executive reported weak business in july while other respondents characterized sales as good or excellent several respondents experiencing brisk sales attributed part of their success to heavy promotional campaigns current inventories are clearly above the level of a year ago and several merchants expressed concern that inventories were somewhat higher than desired generally however retailers judged the build up in the stocks of inventories as moderate and anticipated that sales in coming monthsbuoyed by seasonal promotional campaignswould reduce any excesses among product lines home furnishings stocks in particular were noted as high relative to sales according to respondents with outlets in new york city and other parts of the district merchandising in new york city appears to be outpacing other outletsconsumer spending outside of department stores remains strong with new automobiles continuing to sell well several directors felt auto inventories were inching upward but these increases were judged as failing to keep pace with the optimistic sales outlook and there were scattered reports of inventory shortfalls several leading dealers reported shortages of specific models and depleted inventories were retarding sales one respondent contended that sales could be as much as twenty percent higher if orders were adequately filledthe economic outlook for the upstate area remains cautiously upbeat producers of machine tools and other capital equipment continue to do good business new orders are strong at most firms and one supplier related reports that some companies had expanded into third shifts in an attempt to shorten delivery lags in general however directors noted no unusual tendency for firms to expand production by adding work shifts agricultural incomes in western new york have been bolstered by sizable harvests and unexpectedly high prices for cherries cabbage and corn as a consequence agricultural equipment reportedly has been selling well although one upstate director attributed part of this strength to a growing sentiment among farmers to buy now in order to beat inflationrespondents views of the financial outlook were varied but all agreed there were few signs of an impending liquidity crunch the president of a major new york city bank noted that his economists were predicting a loosening of credit around years end another leading banker foresaw no serious problems but thought thrift institutions were becoming a bit more vulnerable banking directors of the buffalo branch observed some tendency for companies in the rochester area to increase their lines of creditperhaps in anticipation of future difficulties in obtaining funds for capital expenditures still commercial lending in the upstate region has not changed much of late though installment loans and credit card outstandings are up substantially over a year agoelsewhere on the financial scene a survey of new york mutual savings banks indicates that the new sixmonth time certificates are augmenting deposit flows indeed one senior official at a leading savings institution felt that the new instruments had led to a reversal in the pattern of outflows typically experienced at this juncture most contacts were somewhat more reserved in assessing the success of the new certificates echoing the view of many respondents the chairman of major savings bank held that the certificates had moderated the deposit outflows in terms of the impact of the new certificates on the profitability of thrift institutions respondents at large savings banks felt that the new instruments would raise profits since their mortgage lending is implemented by purchasing passthrough securities at rates that exceed new yorks usury ceiling there was concern however that the profitability of smaller mortgage lenders which primarily serve local markets would be adversely affected
1293,1293,9-13-1978,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity continued to advance in august at a moderate pace according to recent comments of directors and other business leaders retailers chalked up only modest gains but with a pick up in sales in early september merchants remained optimistic about autumn sales prospects outside of retailing economic activity seems to be expanding with slightly less vigor than in recent months respondents reported ample supplies of materials and most kinds of skilled workers so that production apparently could be increased in the event that the tempo of economic activity were to pick up there is little indication that business demands for external financing will change materially in the near term loan demand at new york city banks has firmed up a bit reportedly in part due to a spillover of demand from regional banksretail sales in the second district registered only modest gains in august a spokesman for one national retailer noted that his companys sales in the second district have lagged behind those rung up elsewhere in the country several other retailers in new york city mentioned that their sales last month fell short of what had previously been projected none of the merchants felt that the citys newspaper strike had contributed to the sluggishness of sales notwithstanding the modest overall gains consumer purchases of appliances and new cars reportedly held up fairly well in august and several retailers indicated that sales receipts had snapped back in the first week of september indeed merchants appear to be generally optimistic about the prospects for autumn retail salesbusiness activity outside of retailing turned in a mixed performance in august some businessmen reported that their new orders were growing at a healthy clip but others experienced a bit of a slowdown likewise some businessmen reported that delivery lags were lengthening slightly while others saw them shortening there was virtually unanimous agreement among respondents that there were no materials shortages or bottlenecks one director did mention that the petroleum industry had recently had a little difficulty in purchasing lime and oil well cement isolated shortages of certain kinds of skilled workers were mentioned by several businessmen from the new york city region who faced problems in hiringwhile the directors and other business leaders were disturbed over the recent pace of inflation they are in general agreement that a slowdown is in the offing for the second half of this year nevertheless there are a few scattered reports that materials prices are beginning to rise at a somewhat faster ratethough evidently not so fast that the price rises are perceived to be symptomatic of any underlying shortages one director was especially concerned about the unusually big price hikes that have occurred in the new equipment sector in recent years according to another director some manufacturers have lately tried to hold down their output prices through substitution of materials and compromising somewhat the quality of their goods despite the outlook for a slowing in inflation the rate of price increases remains worrisomebusiness demands for external financing are not expected to change substantially through the remainder of 1978 and early 1979 most respondents foresee little change in the pace of business borrowing on the one hand one director thought that there might be a decline in such borrowing because of a slowdown in economic growth and a consequent reduction in the rate of inventory accumulation in contrast other directors felt there would be an increase in borrowing one director indicated that the firms with which he was acquainted appeared to be borrowing short term to finance their capital expansion in anticipation that interest rates will be turning down in the foreseeable futurea survey of business loan developments at several major new york city commercial banks suggests a firming in loan demand only one respondent failed to register an increase in loans during august a month which was cited by two respondents as typically being a somewhat slack month for commercial and industrial borrowings all five respondents reported various signs of loan demand spilling over from regional banks who for reasons such as liquidity strains or capital limitations were either unable or unwilling to fully satisfy specific customers loan demand currently the spillover demand has most commonly taken the form of loan participations offered by smaller regional correspondents although some respondents also cited outright loan purchases and instances in which a correspondent referred customers directly to the respondent new york city bank despite some firming in loan demand at new york city banks most respondents noted that some belowprime lending continued one bank emphasized that agencies and branches of foreign banks in the us had used cut rate loan terms to attract existing business of large new york city banks looking to the nearterm business loan demand nearly all of the respondents expected either continued moderate expansion or some pick up
1305,1305,10-11-1978,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity continued to advance in september at a moderate pace according to recent comments of directors and other business leaders retail sales turned in a respectable performance despite the newspaper strike and retailers seem to be guardedly optimistic about their prospects for the rest of the year elsewhere in the regional economy business activity appears to be advancing nicely while most respondents appear satisfied with current and nearterm sales businessmen are still keeping a tight rein on inventories indeed in some cases inventories reportedly are so lean that they have resulted in some stretching of delivery schedules looking ahead there is an emerging consensus among respondents that the pace of business activity will slow down next year capital spending is expected to hold up while consumers become more tightfisted the recent firming in business loan demand at the new york city banks is also expected to continueretail sales in the second district chalked up healthy gains in september merchants in new york city reported that their sales were running slightly ahead of last years pace they felt that sales would have been even higher had it not been for the citys ongoing newspaper strike especially hard hit by the strike have been the sales of bigticket durable goods since they depend more heavily on advertised salespromotions than do other consumer goods also stores in manhattan have been the ones most affected by the strike elsewhere in the second district and especially in new jersey retail sales have been fairly strong across a broad line of goods neither retailers nor bankers professed to be worried about the muchpublicized buildup of consumers indebtedness almost without exception the delinquency rates on consumer loans are reportedly remaining at comfortably low levels and most consumer creditors feel that their customers are currently managing their debts quite welloutside of retailing business activity appears to be advancing at a moderately brisk pace most businessmen who were contacted echoed the assessment of one upstate manufacturer of machine tools that business was good and there were no clouds hanging over the economyexcept for inflation many businessmen feel that what is needed in the fight against inflation is a comprehensive andwellcoordinated program at the same time they are also very disturbed about the proliferation of government rules and regulations which result in nonproductive costs and delays in any event while there are no apparent shortages in materials some producers appear to be nearing the limits of capacity nevertheless virtually none of the directors or businessmen contacted anticipated a material change in the pace of capital spending for example one upstate manufacturer indicated that his firm was now bumping up against capacity ceilings for both brass and aluminum mill products but does not plan to expand plant and equipment outlays at this time when asked about the economic outlook for the next year and a half most respondents foresee a slowdown in the rate of economic growth for the first half of 1979but not an outright recession as a rule this projected slowdown is seen as the result of belttightening by consumers with little attendant change in the rate of capital spendingbusiness loan demand in the second district is expected to retain its recent strength according to a survey of loan officers and economists at major new york commercial banks the respondents were generally optimistic concerning the nearterm business loan outlook despite rises in interest rates and competition from u s offices of foreign banks all respondents confirmed receiving spillover loan demand from regional banks which primarily took the form of loan participations there was disagreement to what extent these referrals reflect the increasingly loaned up positions on the part of the regionals or the size of individual loans that sometimes are too large for a single regional bank to handle for either legal or policy reasons in any case respondents assigned varying degrees of importance to spillover loans in boosting new york loan demandthe majority of respondents gave optimistic forecasts of loan growth through the first half of 1979 all those questioned said that increases in interest rates have not yet affected loan demand everyone acknowledged loan competition byus agencies and branches of foreign banks however some uncertainty was voiced concerning how much of this business was with traditional customers and whether the loans to nontraditional customers were similar in quality to those loans usually made to large domestic firms
1317,1317,11-15-1978,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the expansion in business activity in the second district apparently slowed in october judging from recent comments of directors and business leaders on the national outlook there is growing concern and anxiety about the stubbornly high rate of inflation and the recent sharp runup in interest rates respondents were uncertain as to how successful the new wage and price guidelines would be in stemming inflation with a few even reporting some companies raising prices apparently in anticipation of an eventual return to mandatory price controls at the same time many view the program designed to shore up the value of the us dollar in the foreign exchange markets as appreciably increasing the chances of a recession next year against this national economic outlook apprehensions have been voiced about the business prospects for the regional economy on the financial scene now accounts have been introduced in new york so that it is unlikely that many automatic transfer accounts will be offeredretail sales turned in a mixed performance in the district while retail sales were fairly strong in western new york the autumn buying season in upstate new york fell below the expectations of directors of the buffalo branchas evidence of the mixed signals being emitted by consumers some major department stores in new york city reported healthy gains while others registered disappointment at the low level of october sales the prolonged newspaper strike was blamed by several new york city merchants as contributing to the sluggishness in retail sales but a few observers interpreted the slowing as evidence of an incipient weakness that may presage a retrenchment by consumers nonetheless merchants are looking forward to the christmas season although the traditional seasonal optimism appears to have been dampened by this undercurrent of trepidation auto dealers in the second district also reported a softening in consumer spendingoutside of the consumer sector the mood of business appears to be sober and cautious a spokesman for an upstate manufacturer whose comments were echoed by many manufacturers reported that business was flat and was probably going to stay that way for a while another telling indicator is that the capital spending plans of companies in such diverse industries as chemicals steel paper and prefabricated metals show no evidence of strengthening or have been even pared an increasing number of businesses now seem to regard the prospect of a recession next year as a foregone conclusion in this connection the sharp rise in interest rates and the other moves taken to defend the us dollar were judged to have appreciably increased the chances that there will be a recessionrespondents were generally unenthusiastic about the probable success of the wage and price guidelines in slowing the rate of inflation it was generally felt that while business management would do its part in holding price increases to the level sought by the president unions were unlikely to cooperate indeed the buffalo directors thought that the antiinflation program was misguided it was their feeling that the government itself was contributing importantly to the current inflationary environment through a host of wayseg the minimum wage social security taxes continued high deficit spending onerous regulatory burdens etc at the same time a number of businessmen indicated that they knew of instances where prices appeared to have been increased in anticipation of mandatory price controls still the overall impression is that there is little if any real evidence of such increases and the practice appears to be far from widespreadthe offering of automatic transfer service is not likely to become very widespread in new york state according to a recent survey of second district banks most new york banks contacted said they plan to offer now accounts instead the recently enacted banking act authorized federally chartered financial institutions in new york state to offer now accounts and this privilege was recently extended to state chartered institutions by the state banking authorities of the 30 new york banks surveyed only four two of which were new york city wholesale banks said they did not plan to offer either ats or now accounts in contrast all the new jersey banks surveyed said they were already offering ats banks with automatic transfer service estimated that about 60 percent of the balances came from demand deposits at the same bank with most of the remaining funds coming from savings deposits also at the same bank

1383,1383,5-16-1979,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,second district business activity continued to expand at a modest pace in april and early nay according to recent comments of directors and other business leaders although department store sales have been mixed automobile sales have remained brisk in general manufacturers appear to be operating near or at full employment inventories are below desired levels and some firms report that order backlogs extend well into 1980 for the most part however labor and materials are generally in adequate supply although some scattered shortages have cropped up on the financial front business loan demand surged at major new york city banksaccording to reports from throughout the second district retail sales have been mixed in recent weeks while virtually all of the large merchandisers enjoyed an acceptable easter selling season several have been experiencing sluggish sales of late in general for all of april and early may sales volumes have exceeded retailers expectations with exceptionally strong sales at new york city stores outperforming weaker suburban branches correspondingly most merchants report that their inventory stocks are in fine shape retail respondents were generally reticent about their outlook for consumers spending but one major chain store did confirm that its outlook for retailing activity in new york city was optimistic enough that it was planning to increase its investment in its manhattan flagship storesales of new cars have continued to be brisk especially for the smaller more fuel efficient models indeed dealers report that sales would be even greater if they had had sufficient numbers of small cars in inventory nevertheless some signs of an industrywide slowdown are emerging one auto analyst reports that the burst in smallcar buying has not been sufficient to offset the largecar sales decline truck purchases in particular have fallen more than anticipated and there has been a remarkable softening in the recreational vehicles sector moreover while small car production is expected to remain strong automotive manufacturers will probably soon begin to shut down their large car assembly plants in order to retool them as a result the regional economy will be affected by some largecar plant closings and the accompanying layoffs of assembly workers but both industry analysts and auto dealers feel that the current gascrisis psychology is temporary and thus will not have a permanent debilitating impact upon the auto industry nonetheless there is a feeling that there is an emerging shift in buyer preferences for smaller more fuel efficient automobilesoutside of retailing business activity remains robust the cement paper steel and computer industries are all at full capacity and in some instances have order backlogs that extend well into 1980 while no serious bottleneck has yet developed for any raw material respondents from the steel and chemical industries each reported lengthening delivery times by their suppliers capital spending plans among district respondents remain strong but are little changed from recent months there is however incipient weakness in the orders being booked by manufacturers of durable consumer goods such as cameras and kitchen ware in any event overall inventories are running on the lean side according to the consensus of businessmen contacted in the district looking ahead the majority of second district respondents anticipate a recession albeit a mild one in the second half of the year as a consequence of continuing inflation increasing oil prices and the high level of consumer debt at the same time while the respondents concede that the administrations antiinflation program has had some effect they are skeptical that it will succeed in reducing the rate of inflation to the range of 6 to 6 12 percenton the financial scene business loan demand surged at new york city banks the senior lending officers who were contacted attributed part of advance in business lending to the growth in plant and equipment expenditures and inventory investment other factors mentioned were a reduced level of corporate cash flow increased acquisitions and aggressive loan pricing while predicting continued growth in commercial and industrial loans through 1979 most respondents failed to foresee a boom in demand comparable to that experienced in 197374
1396,1396,7-5-1979,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity in the second district activity appears to have slowed in june according to recent comments of directors and other business leaders shortages of gasoline appear to have reduced consumer spending department store sales were mixed and sales of new automobiles declined for the most part production levels of manufacturers appear to have remained strong although order backlogs have been trimmed in some instances while most respondents voice little concern over the level of inventories a growing number noted that their inventories were growing the work stoppage by independent truckers appears to have delayed deliveries of many products but has yet to create substantial disruptions on the financial scene credit demands remain strongaccording to reports from throughout the second district department store sales were mixed in june respondents attributed at least part of the slowing to shortages of gasoline the present gasoline shortage has apparently given a competitive edge to downtown stores sales in new york city reportedly were 5 to 10 percent higher than last year while suburban stores suffered declines of 5 to 10 percent despite these current problems many retailers remain optimistic about the future based on the experience of california they expect sales to return to normal once the gas crisis atmosphere disappears as a consequence many merchants voiced little concern over inventory levels at the same time however less optimistic assessments were offered by a growing number of respondents these retailers reported they had lowered their sales projections and were holding down inventory stocks in their view consumers heavy indebtedness the eroding purchasing power of consumers incomes and uncertainties over the prospects for continued business expansion were affecting consumer behaviorin addition to dampening department store sales the gasoline shortage appears to have weakened sales of new cars in particular sales of large cars have slowed considerably sales of the more fuelefficient intermediate and small cars have remained strong or in some instances have risen dramatically depleted inventories of these smallsized cars were viewed by several automobile retailers as restraining sales while major automobile manufacturers announced cutbacks in the production of large cars the effect of the cutbacks in new york and new jersey are unlikely to be severe since the majority of assembly plants located here produce intermediateand smallsized carsoutside of retailing business activity also appears to be moderating most producers are fully booked for the near term but order backlogs have fallen somewhat for paper products and intermediate nonferrous metal products for the most part production levels are remaining steady a notable exception is one major supplier of photographic equipment and supplies this firm is beginning to curtail production in response to weaker sales and some buildup in inventories at least at this point however most business respondents report that inventory levels generally are in line with shipments little concern was voiced over shortages although a few firms are being adversely affected by shipping delays and uncertainties due to transportation delays caused by the work stoppage of independent truckers still some materials in short supply plastic pellets for molded parts and the costs of others such as feedstocks for chemicals are rising rapidlyon the financial scene the demand for credit remains strong officials at several major banks in new york city report continued strong demand for business loans these respondents foresee no marked weakness in the demand for business loans during the second half of 1979 in their view the demand for financing of acquisitions and inventories will remain strong and bolster business borrowing with respect to current business loan demand most respondents failed to see any evidence that inventory accumulation or the energy situation were playing an especially important role in raising financing demands several bankers did cite the growing importance of loans to finance acquisitions the consensus view was that the prime rate has peaked and will remain at its current level through the third quarter and in line with shortterm market rates will decline during the fourth quarter outside of the business sector demand for consumer credit and home mortgages in the second district also remains strong the directors of the buffalo branch reported that the rise in new york states usury ceiling on home mortgage interest rates to 9 34 percent had had little impact on the availability of mortgage funds because it remained well below market interest rates in new jersey an official of a leading thrift institution felt that the rise in that states usury ceiling to 10 12 percent had noticeably increased the supply of funds
1410,1410,8-7-1979,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity in the second district appeared to weaken in july according to recent comments of directors and other business leaders the weakening was most pronounced in consumer spending with department store sales and new car sales falling well short of respondents expectations outside of retailing new orders have slowed and inventory stocks have grown the unintended inventory accumulation generally appears to be relatively modest and only a few manufacturers plan to lower production levels nonetheless some businesses have responded to the weakening in business activity by curtailing planned capital spending on the financial front the demand for bank credit has burgeoned apparently bolstered by the need to finance higher stocks of inventories and by reduced corporate cash flowconsumer spending in the second district slowed in july almost without exception merchants reported that department store sales were well below planned levels while the impact of the gasoline shortage was generally considered to have been concentrated in june respondents judged that some effects spilled into july reflecting the lingering effects of the gasoline shortage sales of stores located in suburban shopping malls have been noticeably weaker than at city branches retailers also noted a drop in sunday sales and an increase in the average size of each transaction as consumers consolidate their shopping trips inventories of most general merchandise stores appear to be on the high side relative to sales but most respondents professed little concern over the level of stocks an exception appeared to be apparel lines that had experienced an unusual softening in demand for these lines merchants are considering additional markdowns and clearances the directors of the buffalo branch were little concerned with the effect of the availability of gasoline on consumer spending they were anxious over the longer term effects of the energy problem on inflation and the impact of higher fuel bills on discretionary spendingnew car sales in the district remain weak while small cars are selling briskly sales of larger cars and trucks are stagnant the inventory situation reflects these divergent sales patterns new car dealers report that small car stocks are almost nonexistent while large car inventories are bulging in order to spur sales and reduce the backlog of unsold large cars dealers in new york and new jersey noted that substantial price breaks were being offered on new large carsoutside of retailing respondents expect the slowdown in economic activity to continue but most see little immediate impact on their production most respondents reported that they are attempting to keep inventories at lean to reasonable levels while there apparently was some unintended accumulation of inventories most felt that inventories were not excessive at the present time confirming this viewpoint a senior official of a major new york city bank noted that manufacturing inventories have grown but maintained that they were still generally in balance because of a growing cautiousness on the part of business capital spending plans in several industries have been reduced as a result of the business slowdown in other industries however plans have been unaffecteda major steel producer and an upstate machine tools manufacturer reported no change in capital spending in addition the buffalo branch directors noted that planned capital expenditures were going ahead on schedule in the buffalo and rochester areas in new jersey however a machine tools manufacturer and a diversified chemicals company announced cutbacks in spending plans some of the directors at the head office reported that businesses were reassessing their capital spending programs while others had not detected any deferral of previously planned outlaysbusiness loan demand at new york city banks has been exceptionally strong in recent weeks officials at the banks contacted cited firms needs to finance higher levels of inventories as an important factor underlying the rapid growth of loan demand other factors mentioned included weakened corporate cash flows continued capital spending and mergers and acquisitions most respondents expected growth in loan demand to continue strong for most of this year before moderating or even declining in late 1979 and early 1980
1426,1426,9-12-1979,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity in the second district appears to have regained some of the ground it had lost earlier in the summer according to recent comments of directors and other business leaders consumer spending strengthened from its summer doldrums using heavy promotions and large price markdowns department stores registered record sales and pared inventories to leaner levels sales of new automobiles also posted a strong gain helping dealers get out from under their bloated largecar inventories outside of retailing most respondents remain cautious new orders have been sluggish but production schedules have been adjusted to prevent an excessive inventory buildup although there is widespread agreement that the economic slowdown will not bottom out until next year most capital spending plans remain unchanged on the financial front business loan demand continues strong with little evidence of tightening in credit standards or nonprice lending termsconsumer spending in the second district turned in an unexpectedly healthy showing in august retailers chalked up record sales one nationwide chain reported that its sales were more than 20 percent ahead of last year as in recent months sales at new york city stores outpaced those at suburban branches but with the easing of the gas shortage the suburban branches have lately made a strong comeback still retailers are unanimously conservative in their outlook for coming months expressing some concern that the upturn may be the shortlived result of heavy promotions and markdowns thus while stores are planning to replenish their depleted inventory stocks they intend to keep inventories on the lean sidein recent weeks there has been a noticeable improvement in the automotive sector smallcar sales continue to boom with no letup in sight lately moreover there has been an advance in the sales of intermediate and fullsize vehicles dealers attribute this pickup both to an easing of the gas shortage and to heavy price promotions price incentives have reportedly been running about 700 per gm car and to as much as 1900 per chrysler car used car sales have been brisk as a result the bulging stocks of new and used largersize models have now been brought down to more manageable levels truck sales are also up though they remain well below the rapid pace of early 1979 respondents are not aware of any financing problems and consumer credit seems readily available it does appear however that consumers are lengthening loan maturities fouryear auto loans now are becoming quite commonoutside of retailing business activity appears to be holding up fairly well new orders do seem to have weakened a bit but most businesses report no change in their capital spending plans one major steel company feels that it will be well insulated from an economic downturn as any future slackening which may occur in capital goods production will be compensated for by a rebound in the production of consumer goods in general however the consensus forecast is for a relatively mild slowdown brought on by sluggish consumption spending and lasting through the early part of 1980 yet apart from the auto sector there is little evidence of a recession in either western new york or the downstate region nor are there reports of any involuntary inventory accumulation indeed one metals company has been running such a tight inventory policy that it experienced stockouts of certain items other companies report that they are shipping goods out about as fast as they are producing them maintaining their inventories at comfortable levelson the financial front there were no signs of a let up in credit demands senior loan officers at major new york city banks indicate little change in bank lending policies on business loans and do not expect a near term slowdown in the demand for such credit while a few respondents expressed less willingness by their banks to extend loan commitments at predetermined interest rates most revealed no tendency to tighten the criteria used to screen business loan applicants the consensus of respondents expects business loan demand to continue at the present rapid pace inventory investment was the factor most frequently cited as bolstering loan demand with respect to mortgage markets financing in new york state is extremely tight according to the comments of the buffalo branch directors because of the state usury ceiling the statechartered lending institutions are committing little if any new money to mortgages while the national banks are allocating limited new funds at 11 12 percent interest which are being absorbed very quickly
1440,1440,10-10-1979,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity in the second district has lately turned in a moderately strong performance according to recent comments of directors and other business leaders consumer spending appears to be holding up overall but there are scattered signs of incipient weakness businesses have kept a tight lid on their inventories and their stocks currently seem to be well in balance with sales on the financial front business loan demand has lately surged at the new york city major banks and the funds are reportedly being used to finance inventory and acquisitions requirementsretail sales of many items have been strong in recent weeks most of the large department stores reported that their sales receipts have been running ahead of plans some went on to say that they foresee a yearoveryear gain amounting to 4 or 5 percent in real terms two large national chain stores did indicate however that their sales had flattened out falling below what had been planned a spokesman for one of these chains thought that his companys relatively weak performance might have occurred because its clientele tends to be less affluent than those of the other retail chains actually the problem appears to be more general even among the retailers which recorded satisfactory gains in total sales there were more than the usual number of complaints about weaknesses in particular product lines or in particular areas within the new york region in any event all retailers unanimously reported that their inventories were still in balance with sales the exceptionally high cost of financing is impelling some merchants to consider cutting back their inventories it should be mentioned however that the retailers which were contemplating such a move were the same ones which had experienced a weakening in sales receiptsautomobile sales in the district continue to be brisk sales of small cars are booming and the inventories of certain foreign makes are now down to rockbottom levels moreover the sales of intermediate and fullsized models have also been robust and it appears that dealers have succeeded in eliminating their former excess inventories of large cars indeed the domestic dealers contacted were eagerly awaiting delivery of the largersize 1980 models truck sales however remain flaccid in the face mounting economic uncertainty of course these are the kind of capital goods which are among the first to be postponedoutside of retailing the business situation appears to be fairly resilient while most companies still foresee a nearterm recession they have not themselves been touched by the slowdown a few businesses do report however that sales in certain consumer product lines are beginning to slip most firms still maintain that their inventory positions are well managed and in line with anticipated sales levels companies also generally report no change in their capital spending planscompanies in the second district are worried however about the deteriorating price situation many foresee that the recent uaw settlement is likely to encourage labor unions to strive for larger wage settlements in the nearterm at the same time there is also a distinct feeling that by granting exceptions to particular industries the administration has greatly weakened its voluntary wagerestraint programofficials at some of new york citys major banks described septembers surge in business loans as broadly based the strong demand was mostly attributed to requirements for financing inventory and for acquisitions all respondents reported that the terms of compensating balances have not firmed and that some big loans were still made below prime banks appear to possess much more liquidity now than they did in 1974 most respondents expect business loans to remain strong for the remainder of the year
1453,1453,11-14-1979,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity in the second district continues to expand moderately according to directors business economists and business leaders contacted recently at the same time however there is growing concern and anxiety over the prospects of a national economic downturn consumer spending remains fairly strong although there is evidence of a weakening in the automotive sector inventories generally appear to be in good balance with sales nevertheless in view of the economic uncertainties businesses are concerned over the level of inventory stocks at least at this point it appears that the october 6 policy initiatives have had little affect on the behavior of nonfinancial corporations on the financial front the demand for business credit has slowed at large commercial banks at the same time banks and finance companies appear to have become more selective in their lending tightening nonprice terms and standards of credit worthinessdepartment store sales continued to advance in the second district in october and early november indeed most merchants reported that sales were ahead of plan throughout the region as one executive of a leading national chain put it if this is a recession we retailers need more of them there were some reports of extra promotional activity but these were not widespread retail inventories are generally in good balance with sales but as an executive noted the upcoming christmas seasons is critical none of the retailers contacted perceived any evidence of a recession in their recent sales figuresin contrast to the strength at department stores sales of new cars were mixed in the district sales of small foreign cars were very strong in october running well ahead of last year but some of these purchases were thought to be the result of lagging deliveries in september while order backlogs are sizable for selected smaller models at the dealers contacted inventories have generally been restored to adequate levels with respect to larger domestic makes there appears to have been a considerable falloff in salesoutside of consumer spending business activity appears to be fairly strong while most companies are convinced that a downturn will occur in 1980 shipments have continued to expand with a few exceptions inventories are generally reported to be adequate and in good balance with sales one respondent noted some hedging in raw materials inventories which was more than usual but this appeared to be an exception inventories of paper products are below desired levels due to a strike at the beginning of the yearthe principal exception to the nearterm strength in business activity is the construction sector homebuilding is at a stand still in new york according to one director state usury ceilings on mortgage loans which are far below market rates have led most thrift institutions to abandon the mortgage market construction financing has also become less available one director reported that shopping center development plans have been deferred due to the limited availability of credit at the same time many businessmen also report a noticeable increase in their accounts receivable as their customers have become tardier in paying their bills along these lines the chairman of a major conglomerate noted that food chains were passing up the discount for early payment of their bills which is very unusual there is widespread concern among business economists directors and business leaders that the federal reserves october 6 actions will lead to a credit crunch as yet however no serious borrowing problems have been reported although large corporations are not expected to experience difficulty in obtaining financing it is anticipated that small companies may face problems in obtaining fundsrespondents from several major commercial finance companies which are headquartered in the second district noted that the recent jump in interest rates has had little effect on borrowing demand by businesses in their view the high interest rates have at least at this time not led to adjustments in inventories and receivables a few lenders have on a highly selective basis reduced rates on a temporary basis to those borrowers whose income statements appear particularly vulnerable to current high interest costs the commercial bankers contacted indicated the october 6 policy initiatives had led to a tightening in lending terms they indicated they were evaluating requests for credit very carefully and tightening of standards of credit worthiness
1465,1465,1-29-1980,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity in the second district has been surprisingly resilient in january according to recent comments of district directors and business leaders one of the brightest spots has been retail sales which were generally substantially higher in the first three weeks of the month than most respondents had expected outside of retailing business activity also appears to be holding its own new orders at several industries posted modest recoveries after declining slightly in recent months and inventories seem to have been kept in line with shipments at the same time however cost increases have cut into the profit margins of some companies since they have been unable to raise their prices fully under current market conditions most respondents expect the federal override of state usury ceilings on mortgage interest rates to have little effect on construction activityretailers in the second district generally experienced higherthanexpected sales in the first three weeks of january merchants chalked up good to excellent gains in sales in downstate new york and in new jersey stores in new york city appear to have done slightly better than those in the suburbs sales were mixed however in upstate new york while consumer buying reportedly was brisk in the rochester area it was less sanguine in the buffalo area inventories seem in balance with sales with one major department store actually reporting them to be on the lean side in this vein many of those retailers contacted noted a lengthening in delivery times in some of their faster moving lines because suppliers had been caught with low stocks despite the healthy showing in recent weeks most retailers expect a weakening in sales in the months to comenew car sales appear to have stabilized in the second district with small cars continuing to outsell large ones at the same time truck sales are showing tentative signs of recovering from the doldrums of a few months ago despite the softness in certain automotive lines domestic dealers in this area report inventories are close to desired levels in sharp contrast foreign car dealers have apparently been unable to increase their inventories which reportedly has hurt their sales customers do not appear to be kept out of the market by any tightening of creditoutside the consumer sector business activity for most firms seems to be holding steady or even improving slightly two upstate manufacturers of machine tools report that their orders and sales are continuing at high levels although one did note that inquiries concerning prospective orders has tapered off a bit also reporting gains in orders or sales were companies in such diverse industries as chemicals steel and petroleum refining one manufacturer of photographic equipment indicated that its sales had held up much better than it had been anticipated the strength in consumption spending was cited by one upstate producer of paper boxes and other packaging containers for consumer goods as buttressing his business activity a few firms however do report that they have been hurt by falloffs in homebuilding and automobile salescompanies throughout the second district report severe upward pressure on their costs led by higher energy costs and rising labor costs one paper box producer for example reported that its costs had shot up 25 to 30 percent over the last six months most other companies indicated that their costs had increased by lesser amounts on the order of 10 percent per year the chemical companies contacted cited the rising cost of petroleum as a key element of their costs in addition labor costs have risen under new contracts as well as under the cola provisions of contracts negotiated earlier the higher cost pressures have led to price increases but profit margins remain under pressure many firms are selling in weak markets and have been limited in their ability to raise their prices some firms such as those in the photographic field have been forced by the extraordinary explosion in certain commodity prices to raise their prices significantly just to cover costs these firms may therefore be facing a particularly difficult perioddespite price uncertainties the longerterm outlook for firms is not unfavorable there is some feeling that recent speculative fever in commodity markets may have run its course and oil supplies seem to be coming into balance with demand nevertheless most firms still expect a recession early this year with a recovery later in the year still capital spending plans have not been reduced further strength in the local economy may come from the projected boosts in defense spendingthe temporary federal override of state usury ceilings on mortgage interest rates is expected to result in only a limited increase in homebuilding activity several respondents felt that consumers simply could not afford the high costs of debt service the amount of turnover in housing however was expected to rise as a result of increased availability of mortgage funds
1478,1478,3-11-1980,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity in the second district appears to have been steady in february according to recent comments of directors and other business leaders retail sales appear to be holding up overall although there are scattered signs of incipient weakness outside of retailing business activity continues to advance new orders were generally brisk and firms show no signs of easing their tight rein on inventories at this point there is little evidence that companies are revising their investment plans in light of the recent marked tightening in financial conditions activity in the mortgage market however appears to have virtually collapsedconsumer spending has been somewhat erratic in february and early march most of the major department stores reported strong sales in february which were running well ahead of plans a spokesman for one large national chain store described sales as staggeringly good improved weather was thought to be an important factor however the weather this february was so much milder than last year at least one merchant raised the possibility that some of the strong advance in february may have been borrowed from coming months indeed the bulk of responses point to a distinct slowdown in sales beginning at the end of february that carried over into early march in any event several sources in the fashion industry noted that the high prices for this years new spring line of womens apparel had run into stiff consumer resistance in upstate new york total retail sales were reportedly strong although auto sales had weakened throughout the district retail inventories appear to be in balance with sales and merchants stocking plans reflect a keen concern over an impending recessionoutside of retailing the business situation appears to be fairly resilient in general companies expect a nearterm slowdown especially in view of the recent runup in financing costs still individual companies report that they have not themselves been touched by the projected downturn indeed in recent weeks new orders have been brisk especially for heavy machinery one upstate forge reported that business was booming also high technology defense industries show signs of robust activity in both the buffalo and rochester areasthe recent turbulence in the financial markets has had a diverse impact on business firms evidently as a result of the high cost of finance companies appear to be tightening the rein on their inventories to the barebones minimum they report that their inventory positions are well managed and in line with the anticipated slowdown in their sales levels companies also generally report no change in their capital spending plans despite the current tight financial market conditions money was said to be amply available but at extraordinarily high interest rates as of now the high financing charges apparently have not proved to be much of a deterrent for firms planned capital spending capital spending appears to be strongly affected by the inflation psychology of spend now since it will cost more laterelsewhere on the financial scene however mortgage lending appears to have come to a screeching halt whereas mortgage interest rates in new york and new jersey had been subject to usury ceilings which were among the lowest in the nation the federal override has freed them at least temporarily in recent weeks then mortgage rates have skyrocketed to levels of 15 percent or more indeed at least one large commercial bank is charging 17 percent plus two points for coop loans in new york city at those rates prospective homebuyers are reportedly postponing their planshoping that rates will decline soon at the same time the high cost of funds has led to a worsening in the outflows of deposits at thrift institutions and sharply reduced their profitabilitywithin the second district state and local governments are encountering financial problems unanticipated at the time of their budget preparations new york state which in january proposed an austere budget for the fiscal year beginning april 1 will face sharply higher credit costs next month at that time it must sell about 3 billion in shortterm notes presently prevailing credit market conditions are expected to cost the state as much as 80 million more than it had expected in the case of new york city adverse market conditions have caused the city to postpone a scheduled sale of 125 million in bonds although some of this borrowing was to be used to finance current expenses an unforeseen 275 million cash surplus will be used instead
1494,1494,4-15-1980,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,signs of an economic slowdown in the second district have multiplied in recent weeks according to the comments of district directors and business leaders although some retailers continue to report strong sales most have experienced declines in march and early april increased economic uncertainties and tightening credit conditions appear to be causing consumers to become more cautious in spending the pressures of record interest rates and reduced credit availability also appear to be causing businesses to rethink spending plans new orders have become decidedly mixed inventories are generally viewed to be at satisfactory levelsconsumer spending weakened in the second district during march and early april several major department stores reported that retail sales declined during march and early april in both suburban and metropolitan stores the adverse impact of the new york transit strike has been felt in the manhattan stores of the major retailers contacted upstate the directors of the buffalo branch noted that consumer attitudes appear to be changing and that households are becoming increasingly cautious in their attitude toward spending in contrast to the decline in consumer spending reported by most respondents two major retailers reported strong sales increases for this period throughout the area which surpassed expectations this was attributable in part to an earlier easter this year than last thus sales may partially be borrowed from next months volume nevertheless spokesmen for these concerns maintained that their sales figures reflected an underlying strength in demand retail inventories generally appear to be at satisfactory levelsdomestic car sales also have weakened in recent weeks all of the dealers contacted reported a softening in sales several automobile dealers attributed the downturn in used car sales to a lack of financing tightening credit standards also appear to be hampering new car sales as well but to a much lesser extent several respondents noted that the usury ceiling on automobile loans was far below market interest rate levels in this environment lenders have substantially tightened standards of credit worthiness lowerincome groups appear to have been most severely affected by the tightening in lending practices the record costs of financing inventories and weak sales prospects have caused several auto dealers to go out of business and more are contemplating such a move in the near future while total domestic sales languish foreign imports continue to sell brisklyoutside the consumer sector business activity was mixed but respondents voiced growing pessimism over the economic prospects for the rest of the year two upstate manufacturers of machine tools reported that current business was good with strong backlogs but one expects a drastic dropoff for the economy some unexpectedly rapid material price increases have been felt but these higher costs largely through a switchover to pricing at delivery instead of a fixed price have been passed on to customers in the form of higher prices industrial respondents were worried that the recent credit control measures would reduce orders by small firms who typically use thirdparty financing inventories at the firms contacted were reported to be low due to preannounced price increases several businesses indicated they were rethinking capital spending plans due to the record level of interest rates many small discretionary purchases already have been canceledin general the industrial outlook is becoming pessimistic spokesmen for such diverse industries as chemicals paper metals and petroleum refining expressed the belief that a recession is either imminent or has already begun an official of a major metals manufacturer echoed the view of many respondents in indicating that the outlook is particularly bleak because of the decline in housing starts the fall in automobile production and the recent credit tightening brass and copper product shipments are expected to fall 25 to 30 percent in 1980 relative to 1979 levels with rising labor costs and high energy costs profits are expected to erode a similarly pessimistic outlook was voiced by an upstate producer of paper products who noted that certain lines such as food packaging are showing signs of softness and much slippage is anticipated in shipments recent credit tightening measures are expected to have a large impact on paper demand inventories generally are about their desired levels
1508,1508,5-14-1980,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity in the second district continued to lose momentum in april consumer spending weakened at major department stores across the district at the same time that automobile sales were lethargic outside the consumer sector the outlook was generally pessimistic manufacturing firms in many industries have started to reduce their workforces in the face of declining new orders and shrinking backlogs cautious inventory policies however appear to have kept stocks from growing excessive many firms also have began to reassess capital spending plans but there has been only limited retrenchment thus far on the financial side business loan demand at major new york city banks slowed as some companies shifted to the longterm corporate bond and commercial paper markets to meet credit needsconsumer spending in the second district weakened in april the elevenday transit strike in new york city contributed to the downturn at metropolitan stores but a similar slackening occurred throughout the region while monthly sales comparisons are distorted by the effects of the transit strike and timing of the early easter selling season merchants voiced concern that the recent poor performance of sales was indicative of a more prolonged economic slowdown credit financing of sales fell at a major department store chain while another store reported a shift from credit to cash transactions this downturn is occurring although relatively little reportedly is being done by these respondents to directly discourage credit card usage in spite of lagging sales conservative inventory policies have kept stocks at acceptable levelsdomestic car sales fell sharply in april with few exceptions dealers in the second district reported a severe falloff in new car and truck purchases in some instances sales declined by as much as 40 to 50 percent in the last 10day selling period in the month floor traffic at one dealership reportedly ceased and as a result no new orders were being booked demand for used cars however has remained relatively strong and their prices are rising sharply due to the increasing scarcity of supply as potential buyers postpone the replacement of their old models until they are no longer serviceable dealers in new york state were concerned that the states usury ceiling on automobile loans was restricting financing all of the respondents felt that local financing problems were being exaggerated by media coverage which was scaring away even those customers still eligible for finance company loans dealer stocks are lean however reflecting dim sales prospects and the high cost of financing inventoriesoutside the consumer sector overall business conditions also have deteriorated in recent weeks a sharp dramatic falloff in new orders and a shortening in lead times was reported by manufacturers in such diverse industries as paper products chemicals consumer and industrial metals electronic and photographic supplies and steel several firms have begun to reduce their staffs both through attrition and layoffs in some divisions of a major metals manufacturer layoffs have affected 30 percent of the workforce in contrast to other district producers machine tool manufacturers so far have been relatively insulated from the downturn backlogs at these firms are still growing as new orders remain strong while some raw material prices have abated cost pressures remain intense both labor and energy costs have continued to rise despite the uncertain economic conditions and the high cost of financing however relatively few firms have marked down their capital investment plans with the exception of a major chemical firm which reported excessive inventory stocks inventories remain at acceptable levelsin general the industrial outlook became more markedly pessimistic during april expectations of a longer and deeper recession have grown upstate business leaders note widespread layoffs in construction and autorelated industries downstate further economic dislocations are imminent with the planned closing of a major new jersey auto plant in june this shutdown will result in direct permanent job losses to 3700 workers in addition to the 800 already laid off further job cutbacks and losses in income are expected as the ripple effects of this plant closing work through the local economy most respondents do not anticipate a recovery in national business activity until the first half of 1981 but with the exception of a steel industry spokesman who feared the effects of continuing inflation and foreign competition the longrun outlook for the 1980s remains positive with strong growth in demand expected for all productsthe weakening in business activity has been reflected in credit demands new york city banks have experienced a sharp easing in business loan demand which they expect to continue over the remainder of the year while there has been some tightening in nonprice lending terms senior loan officers attribute most of the weakness to a combination of the recessionary environment the lean inventory situation and some shifting to longterm financing moreover given the current spread between the prime rate and commercial paper rates some firms apparently have recently turned to the commercial paper market for shortterm funds
1522,1522,7-1-1980,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity in the second district declined in may although the decline appears less rapid than in april consumer spending at some major department stores showed signs of picking up but domestic automobile sales continued soft there is no evidence that the recent easing of the consumer credit controls spurred spending outside the consumer sector the outlook was generally pessimistic new orders declined further or stabilized at low levels for many manufacturing firms production cutbacks as orders fell have limited inventory buildups despite the uncertain economic conditions few changes have been made in capital spending plans and capital goods producers still report strong demand the weakening in demand has reduced the upward pressures on prices on the financial side loan demand continues to languish despite the recent sharp decline in interest ratesconsumer spending in the second district was mixed in may sales at retailers that cater to highincome consumers in manhattan and nearby new york suburbs generally improved over aprils disappointing levels still sales remained below januarys and februarys levels a large influx of tourists and foreign visitors helps account for some of the good showing in manhattan but the sales at the new york suburban malls also point to an underlying strength other large retailers reported sales to be disappointing and did not expect a pickup until the end of 1980 the pattern of consumer spending varied in other regions of the second district retail business in new jersey began the month rather sluggishly but then recovered somewhat retail sales in upstate new york remained mixed scattered inventory problems were cited among retailers but tight management seems to have averted any serious difficulties concerns appear to focus on the buildup of certain largeticket itemsdomestic car sales continued soft in may but there were reports of some pickup in june overall conditions have been described as disastrous with many dealerships folding lack of consumer interest and confidence as measured by a low volume of floor traffic were cited as reasons that were more important than lack of credit availability in causing the weakness in sales inventories are in satisfactory shape for the most part imported car sales which had also dropped precipitously in april and may seem to have recovered in june used car sales appear to be picking up as well there are scattered reports of an easing in auto lending credit conditionsoutside the consumer sector overall business conditions have deteriorated further in recent weeks a sharp falloff in new orders was reported by manufacturers in such diverse industries as copper brass and aluminum products machines and tools chemical products industrial packaging and other paper products smaller declines were registered among manufacturers of consumer related nondurable photographic supplies autorelated electrical products and sheet metal sharp declines were reported earlier by firms in such diverse industries as steel fibers large electrical appliances plywood and lumber inventories in these industries are generally at satisfactory levels due to immediate cutbacks in production in response to falling ordersin contrast to other second district producers capital goods manufacturers are still reporting strong demand backlogs remain large and orders are robust similarly business is strong for manufacturers of small electrical appliances and audio equipment the aerospace and the home improvement industries are also doing well it appears that at least at some larger firms plant and equipment spending plans will be maintained despite the nearterm falloff in business activity on the other hand a major chemical firm reduced its current dollar spending plans there are some reports of retailers either reducing their plans or deferring them the most common technique of making adjustments however seems to be stretching out or postponing capital spending rather than reducing its dollar amountwith the economy weakening evidence is mounting of an easing in inflationapparently more marked than in the previous recession list prices have not been lowered all that much but prices are not rising much from the previous month and even some discounts are apparently being offered wage pressures also seem to be easing in response to the weakening in the labor marketsno evidence was seen of any increase in consumer spending resulting from the recent easing of the credit controls instead the psychological impact of the program was still felt to be severe financing terms at commercial banks are reported to have eased in recent weeks all major thrift institutions have lowered mortgage interest rates and some have even begun to aggressively advertise for borrowers business loan demand at banks has not recovered despite the recent drop in interest rates
1538,1538,8-5-1980,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity in the second district remained weak in july although there were some scattered signs of improvement consumer spending strengthened at several higherpriced department stores but sales remained soft at other retailers merchants anticipate some nearterm pickup in demand due to the dismantling of the credit control program outside the consumer sector new orders declined further and several respondents are reassessing their capital spending plans for the first time in the current downturn capital goods producers reported a slowdown in new orders but with large backlogs of unfilled orders no production cutbacks are planned price pressures appear to be abating although strong wage pressures still persist on the financial scene some business lending is reported to be taking place below the prime rateconsumer spending in the second district strengthened in july but the improvement was not widespread department stores catering to upper income customers registered moderate to strong gains at mass marketers and discount chains however sales gains were negligible although most of these retailers expect a pickup this fall from backtoschool purchases credit card usage has been weak at these stores but relatively normal at higherpriced retailers catalogue sales of specialty apparel also have declined while domestic and foreign tourists are a source of strength at manhattan stores most retailers expect sales to be largely unaffected by the influx of visitors associated with the democratic convention inventories are reported to be in line with sales at all stores across the districtdomestic automobile sales in the second district rose moderately in july although dealers report some weakening in recent weeks foreign car sales during this period were excellent however with unusually heavy floor traffic used car sales also have been strengthening the relaxation of credit controls has had a varied impact on automobile sales thus far several respondents report that although financing is now more available in new york state many customers believe that credit is still scarce and rather than risk being refused credit continue to postpone automobile purchases in new york city greater credit availability was cited by respondents as an important factor in the sales upturn automobile inventories are lean with reports of shortages of particular modelsboth compact and fullsizedhampering sales in some instances and causing dealers to swap among themselves in other casesoutside of retailing little improvement in overall business conditions has been noted new orders slackened further at manufacturers of chemicals steel products and photographic and optical equipment but with few exceptions inventories have been wellmanaged and little excessive buildup appears to have occurred indeed for some product lines such as plastics fibers and fertilizers inventories are so low that orders are beginning to rise other firms also expect to see a modest rise in orders as a result of customers depleted inventorieson a positive note some moderation of price pressures has been reported due to easing in the cost of raw materials heavy energy users however are not benefiting from lower costs all that much wage pressures have shown little abatement and one chemical producer is bracing for a strike even though workers in the industry are being laid off capital investment plans at several companies are under review and while spending in 1980 will go ahead as scheduled investment outlays are likely to be reduced in 1981 many companies plan to stretch out and defer spending rather than actually slash investment as a result capital goods manufacturers which until now have been unaffected by the recession are beginning to see a slowdown in new orders their backlogs are sufficiently large at present however that production cutbacks are not necessary moreover these companies expect orders to bounce back in the first half of 1981 in general the overall outlook of respondents is less pessimistic than it has been for the past several months the dismantling of the credit control program is viewed as contributing to overall demand although having little direct impact on individual companieson the financial side business loan demand at large new york city banks while stronger than in recent months remained below the levels posted in the first quarter most of this weakness is attributed to a shift from bank loans to the corporate bond market and to the generally lean inventory situation some shortterm loans to lowrisk borrowers are being made at rates below the prime although there are significant differences among the banks as to nonprice lending terms over the remainder of the year senior loan officers are unsure about the strength in loan demand because of the great uncertainties over the outlook for the economy
1576,1576,9-9-1980,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity in the second district continued to be weak in august although several department stores reported gains spurred by backtoschool purchases sales were soft at others and merchants were uncertain about the outlook for sales in the coming months automobile purchases also remained slow dealers are expecting little improvement until mid1981 despite the introduction of new models outside the consumer sector capital spending plans are still being reassessed at some firms and new orders at capital goods producers continued flat the backlog of unfilled orders at these companies however has forestalled layoffs the respondents for the most part discounted the favorable economic signals recently and generally agreed that the recession was not about to end on the financial side business loan demand while remaining generally weak has shown some signs of picking up at the same time many banks have increased the prime rate to 12 per cent in response to rising market rates the tighter money market conditions have been felt in the mortgage market as well
1577,1577,9-9-1980,New York,Consumer Spending,consumer spending in the second district was uneven during august at both higher priced department stores and mass marketers activity early in the month was stagnant this weakness however was linked to the very hot weather rather than to the recession spurred by backtoschool purchases in the latter part of august many department stores were able to compensate for the earlier weakness and ended the month with fairly strong year overyear gains as has been the case for the last couple of months new york city stores outperformed their suburban branches while in upstate new york the opposite sales pattern prevailed with suburban stores reporting better sales than in the large cities although inventories at most stores were not burdensome one large department store was still concerned over its level of stocks in light of the very uncertain sales outlook this store preferred high stocks however to the possibility of losing sales when demand strengthens in general the outlook of most merchants was cautious and uncertain but on a more positive note one retailer felt that continued caution in consumer spending now may well result in an exceptional christmas season when many postponed purchases might be madeautomobile sales in the second district were also mixed soft early in august but stronger towards the end of the month demand for smallersized used cars has held up well and truck sales were on par with last august according to one respondent however this upturn will not be sustained because it largely stemmed from purchases which could no longer be postponed high interest rates and the sizable downpayment currently being required for automobile loans continue to be major deterrents to sales particularly for lower and middle income customers in some cases however inventory shortages and slow deliveries are hampering sales primarily for foreign cars
1578,1578,9-9-1980,New York,The Manufacturing Sector,outside the consumer sector little evidence of improvement has developed new orders at capital goods producers are minimal although backlogs of unfilled orders are sufficient to prevent layoffs at present inventories at most manufacturers are very low and with liquidation continuing according to one respondent a pickup in economic activity may begin soon albeit a very moderate one as inventories are rebuilt nevertheless one major steel manufacturer has revised downward its longterm capital spending plans and a major review of all plant and equipment spending is underway at a large producer of paper and related products in addition this producer may close certain marginal paper plants soon because it expects to lag the nation during the recovery just as it did in the downturn
1579,1579,9-9-1980,New York,Economic Outlook,the economic outlook of most district respondents was rather pessimistic the recent signs of an upturn were not considered sufficient to trigger a sustained broadbased recovery this year in particular the housing sector is expected to remain weak for some time respondents were divided however in their forecasts of consumer behavior some felt that the current cautious attitude and higher saving rate were only temporary aberrations while others expect consumers to continue to restrain their spending in light of an anticipated renewal of strong inflationary pressures
1580,1580,9-9-1980,New York,Financial Developments,on the financial side business loan demand at large new york city banks remained soft although a little stronger than in previous months senior loan officers attributed this weakness to the lack of major capital spending programs little acquisition activity and the limited need for inventory financing only in the apparel industry was the demand for inventory financing fairly heavy reflecting the increasing cost of funds throughout august banks increased the prime rate to 12 per cent higher interest rates have had a noticeable impact on the mortgage market lending activity has tapered off as the rates on new commitments have been increased from 1 to as much as 2 14 percentage points
1581,1581,9-9-1980,New York,Financial Panel,starting this month we will have comments from several of a group of financial market experts this month we have comments from henry kaufman salomon brothers james oleary us trust company and albert wojnilower first bostonkaufman the backup in interest rates will not prevent a fourth quarter recovery in the economy but it is slowing the reliquefaction of businesses there are now two corporate bond calendarsa highly likely new volume and a shadow calendar which hinges on a 5075 basis point decline in longterm interest rates this decline however can only come about if shortterm interest rates fall otherwise longterm interest rates will be under some upward pressure corporate reliquefaction is also being retarded by the involuntary inventory accumulation the fall in profits and the temporary oil glut the first two factors are likely to be reversing in the period aheadoleary i find almost a universal expectation that the basic inflation rate will not decline appreciably in the near term and that the odds are strong that the inflation rate will escalate again in 1981 and beyond as a result of this expectation and the expectation about interest rates which follows one cannot expect longterm institutional investors to behave as they have in past cycles the authorities need more than ever to take the intensifying expectation of inflation into accountwojnilower notwithstanding some comments to the contrary my own feeling is that the recession is ending this view confirmed by many nonfinancial contacts in financial markets widespread expectation of a double dip recession accordingly despite rise in interest rates lenders more aggressive in pushing out credit thus would anticipate surprises on the high side in business conditions ten percent inflation clearly imbedded in the economy but not in the markets
1622,1622,10-14-1980,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity in the second district continued weak in september although retail sales were uneven for the month some strengthening is anticipated in the coming months automobile purchases remained slow the outlook for car sales is very uncertain because of rising interest rates and recent price hikes for domestic models outside the consumer sector some increase in demand has been reported for machinetool makers and is also expected for chemicals the respondents for the most part do not expect any major economic recovery until the latter half of 1981 on the financial side reports indicate that lending terms for automobile purchases remained unchanged during september in the housing market however credit conditions have tightened considerably
1623,1623,10-14-1980,New York,Consumer Spending,consumer spending in the second district was generally erratic during september sales for the month as a whole both in new york city and nearby suburbs were about in line with retailers expectations in contrast retail sales upstate were somewhat stronger than expected throughout the district inventories were generally satisfactory since most retailers have stressed the importance of following conservative policies credit sales appear to be running at about the same volume as last year retailers are generally optimistic that sales will strengthen as the christmas season approachesautomobile sales in the second district were also mixed in september foreign car sales appeared better than in the comparable month last year while domestic car sales were reported to have declined drastically since the beginning of the month used car sales also appeared to be depressed the october 1 price increases combined with the high financing costs were cited as likely to hurt sales in upcoming months although the report from a major automobile manufacturer suggests a very sharp increase in sales by the third quarter of 1981 the present outlook is described as nervous particular concern was raised over sales of leftover 1980 models and of the 1981 models which are not in the new fuelefficient lines at the same time however it is believed that energy considerations are fading in consumers minds both manufacturers and dealers are deeply concerned over the effects of rising interest rates on the costs of financing 1981 inventories some dealers are considering trimming their inventories again although they fear the reduced selection of cars for potential buyers could hurt sales in future months
1624,1624,10-14-1980,New York,The Manufacturing Sector,outside the consumer sector a few signs of improvement are beginning to appear some machine toolmakers are reporting strengthening sales inventories in this industry are very lean and could result in slow deliveries if a large increase in demand occurs some pickup in orders for chemicals is expected in the next month similarly an increase in steel production is anticipated in 1981 although not enough to reverse the decline experienced in 1980 in association with an expected rise in auto sales in contrast demand for construction materials has weakened and a major manufacturer of sewing machines is phasing out local production idling 850 workers by the end of the year inventories in the oil industry remain high and there are no plans for further additions to stocks elsewhere in the manufacturing sector there has been further inventory liquidation reflecting continued uncertainties at the retail level
1625,1625,10-14-1980,New York,Economic Outlook,the economic outlook of most district respondents was rather bearish although retailers anticipate a strong christmas season other respondents expect consumer spending to remain weak at least through the remainder of this year the principal reasons are high food and fuel prices and rising interest rates the recent upturn in housing starts was widely viewed as temporary and the rise in mortgage rates was expected to produce a downturn relatively soon respondents were divided in their outlook on auto sales no one outside of auto manufacturing however expects a sharp increase in total car sales
1626,1626,10-14-1980,New York,Financial Developments,on the financial side commercial banks in the second district report no change in either lending terms or credit standards for automobile loans during the month of september in the mortgage market however conditions have tightened appreciably commitment and application activity in september are reported to be significantly down from august levels a number of lenders have been offering renegotiable rate mortgages rrms or variable rate mortgages vrms in addition to conventional instruments and some institutions have even shifted to an exclusive rrmvrm policy mortgage rates have increased by about 1 percentage point since early september at present the rate on new conventional mortgage commitments ranges from 13 12 percent plus 2 points to 14 14 percent plus 3 points commitment rates of rrms and vrms are lower
1627,1627,10-14-1980,New York,Financial Panel,this month we have comments from donald riefler morgan guaranty trust company francis schott equitable life assurance society and albert wojnilower first boston their views of course are personal not institutionalriefler while wide swings in both interest rates and money supply figures should be viewed as normal for periods of high and volatile inflation they were exaggerated this year by the imposition and subsequent withdrawal of the credit control program it is essential to the feds credibility and to curtailing inflationary expectations that the fed hit its annual money supply targets i see some tentative early signs that the move upward in rates may be having some effect on inflationary expectations in commodity prices plateauing stability and strength of the dollar and better performance of the bond marketschott the recent interest rate runup is closely related to market perceptions of the deteriorating fiscal 1981 federal budget picture precautionary business borrowingshortterm and longtermis also again a factor by standing firm now the federal reserve may be able to nip in the bud the potential need for another crunch the market may then realize that renewed rapid economic expansion is not actually in the cardswojnilower the tone of asset markets has become more strongly bullish now bond prices have joined triggered mainly by reports that chairman volcker had asserted the market had overanticipated the rise in money rates if ml does not erupt again concerns as to housing weakness and doubledip are apt to recede my own forecast remains for a relatively robust business upturn with some tendency for inflation to reaccelerate
1673,1673,11-12-1980,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity in the second district was mixed in october retail sales strengthened during the month reflecting extensive promotional activity foreign car sales picked up while the slump in domestic car sales deepened no turnaround is expected on the domestic side until late spring outside the consumer sector some signs of a weak pickup have been reported in chemicals machine tools and paper and packaging products the respondents for the most part expect a slight upturn in the fourth quarter but do not anticipate any major economic recovery until the second half of 1981 on the financial side business loans at new york city banks have declined since midoctober in the mortgage market rates have stabilized recently after rising sharply in september and early october
1674,1674,11-12-1980,New York,Consumer Spending,retail sales in the second district have generally strengthened during october sales for the month as a whole both in the new york metropolitan area and upstate were in line with or in a few cases even exceeded retailers expectations and inventories were considered satisfactory although the heavy promotional activity during this period was cited as the reason for much of the brisk sales some underlying strength in consumer spending was perceived especially for soft goods comparisons between the city and suburban stores were mixed in most instances similarly the volume of cash and credit sales did not follow any pattern with the relative vigor of each varying from store to store retailers voiced some concern over november sales because of the late thanksgiving but are planning for a strong christmasautomobile sales in the second district were mixed in october with foreign car sales outperforming domestic foreign car sales were reported to be about as strong as in the comparable month last year with prospects for further improvement in november in contrast domestic car sales are below the volume a year ago and the slump is expected to continue at least until late spring rising auto prices combined with shrinking discretionary income were cited as making consumer spending cautious so that only lower priced leftover1980 models appear to be selling consequently the domestic dealers contacted expect more dealerships to close wherever possible inventories at the dealer level have been kept intentionally lean auto makers voiced concern that any further downturn in sales might place some capital spending plans in jeopardy
1675,1675,11-12-1980,New York,The Manufacturing Sector,outside the consumer sector there are slight signs of improvement some pickup in orders for chemicals has occurred in part because improving conditions in the steel industry have increased demand for chemical products used as inputs in steel production orders for steel increased in august and september but remained flat during october further advances are expected during the coming months principally for customers inventory rebuilding some improvements were noted in paper and packaging products but this was felt to be largely due to advance buying to avoid expected price increases rather than any strong recovery in underlying demand some machine tool makers are reporting strengthening sales though for some companies shipments continue to outpace orders and full recovery in the industry is not anticipated before late 1981
1676,1676,11-12-1980,New York,Economic Outlook,the outlook of most district respondents remains somewhat bearish although most expect some upturn in consumer spending in the fourth quarter they still expect relatively weak growth through the first half of 1981 several respondents suggested that this is going to be a wshaped recession because the economic fundamentals do not warrant a sustained recovery the second downturn is expected to be seen first in the housing sector where permits began to weaken in october higher interest rates were cited as the principal cause of a weakening housing market but the decline is not expected to be as sharp as earlier in the year respondents also observed that capital spending has shown no definite signs of recovery
1677,1677,11-12-1980,New York,Financial Developments,business loans at new york city banks have been weak since mid october in contrast to a large increase in loans at banks outside the second district in the mortgage market rates seemed to have stabilized at about 14 percent the federal override of the mortgage usury ceiling has resulted in the first sale of passthrough securities by a new york mutual savings banka 10 million private placement with three life insurance companies
1678,1678,11-12-1980,New York,Financial Panel,this month we have comments from henry kaufman salomon bros james oleary us trust and robert stone irving trust their views of course are personal not institutionalkaufman while real gnp will probably increase at an annual rate of at least 3 percent in this quarter a slowing in the pace of the recovery is likely in the 1st quarter of 1981 reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and increases in the social security tax in the credit market another wave of new corporate bond offerings is likely to hit the market in the early part of next year when shortterm interest rates are likely to decline for a short period of timemr oleary we are in the midst of a broad revolutionary change in the longterm capital marketsa sharp reduction in the availability of funds for investment in straight longterm fixedrate bonds and mortgages since most investors are convinced that the upward trend of inflation and of interest rates will continue there will continue to be a very highrisk premium in the yields on these instruments and the longterm fixedrate markets will continue to be subject to great volatility the need for the federal reserve to persist in its determination to pursue a policy designed to reduce the inflation rate and to defuse the expectation of inflation is thus most urgent it is imperative that the new republican administration aid the monetary authorities with real fiscal restraint and other longterm policiesmr stone member bank borrowings have now reached levels that should enable the fed to achieve success in its effort to slow the aggregates sufficiently to meet its longer term growth target success could probably be assured by holding borrowings at or slightly above current levels for another three to four weeks as markets begin to perceive such success short rates will drop very rapidlyprobably by 100 to 150 basis points which i judge to be the amount of expectational fluff now in the market rates would then work lower over the balance of the year closing well below present levels i do not believe that the economy will experience a double dip we are however likely to see a pause some time within the next months and this will reinforce the decline in interest rates
1726,1726,12-10-1980,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity in the second district was mixed in november retail sales were generally flat on a constantdollar basis during the month foreign car sales picked up but domestic car sales continued to stagnate outside the consumer sector signs of weakness were spreading among machine toolmakers and in the steel industry the respondents for the most part do not anticipate any major economic recovery before mid1981 on the financial side the suspension of usury ceilings in new york state is expected to raise rates sharply on personal borrowing and weaken demand for such loans strong demand for business loans was reported in the mortgage market financing has generally been available but the demand weak because of the high rates
1727,1727,12-10-1980,New York,Consumer Spending,retail sales in the second district advanced during november only because of price increases after adjusting for inflation retail sales were either flat or showed slight declines except for a few isolated areas of strength there were reports of higher retail inventories but these are not a source of concern at this time of year christmas sales are generally expected to show a moderate increase in nominal terms but to be flat on a real basis the recent removal of usury ceilings on most types of consumer borrowing in new york state is expected to be of little consequence for christmas sales evaluations of the longerterm impact were uncertain but retailers anticipate at least some negative effects especially in cases where customers have maintained fairly high average balancesautomobile sales in the second district followed the pattern of the last few months imports have shown consistent strength while domestic car sales have been generally stagnant as consumers continue to show resistance to the high prices for the newly introduced small cars used car sales are still sluggish reactions to the lifting of state usury ceilings varied although some negative impact on car sales is anticipated most dealers feel that the high auto prices will be the primary factor limiting sales
1728,1728,12-10-1980,New York,The Manufacturing Sector,outside the consumer sector results were variable in contrast to most other sectors sales of paper products and chemicals were reported strong the recent strength in chemicals however was credited to the respondents aggressive new management and not to increased demand throughout the industry sales in the petroleum industry were down in november continuing a yearlong trend which has been attributed primarily to price increases demand for such items as digital watches and small calculators has been strong but this was viewed in part as an indirect result of consumer reluctance to purchase largeticket items inventories of durables were reported to be too high and some cutback in production is anticipated early next year some machine toolmakers were reporting weakening sales particularly for lowerpriced items
1729,1729,12-10-1980,New York,Economic Outlook,the outlook of most district respondents remains bearish most expect no improvement in general economic conditions before the middle of 1981 higher interest rates were cited as a principal cause of the sudden slowdown in the economy indeed recent developments in interest rates have altered the outlook for the steel industry significantly because of its heavy dependence on plant and equipment spending and on the production of durable consumer goods all of these are expected to be adversely affected by rising interest rates respondents also believe that the housing market will decline significantly because purchasers will be reluctant to make commitments at such high rates although mortgage money will be available in the business sector borrowings by large firms from commercial banks at below prime rates are expected to increase respondents also observed that because industrial production is too high for the level of retail sales inventories will begin to accumulate and this will add to the demand for business loans
1730,1730,12-10-1980,New York,Financial Developments,with the suspension of usury ceilings on personal loans effective december 1 consumers in new york state will pay sharply higher rates on personal borrowing with rates of 19 percent for unsecured loans and 18 percent for secured loans demand for personal loans is expected to be weak in the mortgage market the december 4 rise in the discount rate has heightened concern over the availability of mortgage money new commitment activity is down though this is partially seasonal demand is weak throughout the region but is least sluggish in new jersey although there was a net inflow of deposits at sls during november following outflows the previous two months mortgage lending is not expected to increase as a result in the corporate sector even though demand for business loans is strong banks are still aggressively competing for loan customers there seems to be little demand for capital improvement loans strong demand for inventory financing and some substitution of business loans for commercial paper
1731,1731,12-10-1980,New York,Financial Panel,this month we have comments from donald riefler morgan guaranty trust company francis schott equitable life assurance society albert wojnilower first boston company their views of course are personal not institutionalriefler the feds policy is beginning to work inflationary expectations as reflected in the commodity markets and to some degree the stock market are being adjusted downward before too long money supply numbers will also weaken the longterm financial markets have shown remarkably good stability given what has happened to shortterm rates it is important to remember two things markets do overshoot and interest rate levels are reversible because rates can come down there is less reason to be fearful about the longerterm impact of todays interest rates on the economy prospects for autos and housing are not great but otherwise spending should not fall precipitously in the months to comeschott a renewed slowdown in the economyagain led by housing and automobilesis now in the making provided the federal reserve sticks to the objective of curbing the growth of the aggregates interest rates in excess of previous peaks may be required to accomplish the objective partly because there are no direct credit restraints and partly because some sectors of the financial market are still in a relatively liquid position the alternative to restraint now is even more restraint later since underlying inflationary forces are very strongwojnilower economic activity is still expanding rapidly though less so than a few weeks ago except for usuryrelated kinks in bank credit for autos credit is freely available there is virtually no institutional interest in longterm fixedrate bonds nor is such likely to revive in view of the impending conflict between fiscal and monetary policy
1779,1779,1-28-1981,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,business activity in the second district was mixed in late december and january after a weak showing at the beginning of the christmas season retail sales surged at the end with the strength reportedly spilling over into the current month auto sales slipped for both domestic and foreign makes outside of the consumer sector conditions were also mixed for companies in the petroleum chemical and consumer goods industries conditions ranged from stable to improving for companies in the capital goods industries however the situation appears to be deteriorating the respondents generally anticipate sluggish growth in real gnp over 1981 most of which is expected to occur in the second half following the enactment in midyear of a broadbased tax cut on the financial side business loans remain strong while local savings and loan associations experienced a slight net inflow of deposits
1780,1780,1-28-1981,New York,Consumer Spending,despite a slow start in early december retail sales ended up being fairly robust during the christmas season with but one or two exceptions retailers characterized their christmas sales receipts as being super extraordinary and excellent moreover helped along by postchristmas promotional price cutting the strength in retail sales extended into the current year the cold weather stimulated sales of winter clothing and heating equipment in the downstate area but tended to keep some people out of the upstate stores inventory levels are being closely monitoredauto sales in the second district continued to languish in recent weeks in response to the high prices and high interest rates consumers have evidently decided not only to postpone purchasing domestic cars but foreign makes as well inventories are higher than dealers would like and are being cut back as much as possible indeed as one dealer explained with the carrying costs of stocking new domestic cars currently running between 120 and 150 per car per month and the average gross profit per car sold about 500 to 600 dealers stand to lose money if they have to hold on to their inventoried cars for several months
1781,1781,1-28-1981,New York,The Manufacturing Sector,economic conditions in the second district have lately been rather mixed business has apparently held up well for those petroleum and chemical companies which were contacted those companies specializing in the production of consumer goods seem to be in a holding pattern changing neither their inventories nor their capital spending plans in contrast those companies which produce capital goods appear to be having difficulties even in this sector however some companies are evidently doing better than others
1782,1782,1-28-1981,New York,The Economic Outlook,the economic outlook is generally for sluggish real growth in 1981 few companies however anticipate an outright decline in economic activity in the near term many companies are expecting personal and business tax cuts midyear and accordingly foresee a modest strengthening in the economy during the second half the consensus forecast is for real gnp growth of 1 to 112 percent for the entire year no one appears to be unduly disturbed about inflation judging from the fact that only one company even mentioned its price outlook incidentally that one company thinks the cpi will increase between 1012 and 11 percent in 1981
1783,1783,1-28-1981,New York,Financial Developments,in financial markets business loan demand was strong at yearend and most loan officers reported that the loans outstanding were not paid down as quickly in the new year as is usually the case factories supporting the continued business loan strength include the high interest rates in the bond market and the spread between the prime rate and the commercial paper rate in the mortgage market rates on mortgage loans were steady at large commercial banks in new york city but increased slightly at insured savings and loan associations according to a recent survey conducted by the local office of the federal home loan bank board the survey also indicted a slight inflow of deposits net of interest credited at savings and loans in december reflecting in part growth of now accounts
1784,1784,1-28-1981,New York,Financial Panel,this month we have comments from donald riefler morgan guaranty trust company francis schott equitable life assurance society and james oleary us trust companytheir views are personal not institutionalriefler the federal reserve has regained creditability but at the expense of high and volatile interest rates he expects current rates to recede but relatively high rates will persist until inflationary psychology improves a considerable part of present rate volatility is artificial reflecting the fact that the federal reserve has to make certain operating decisions based on forecasts of daytoday changes in reserve factors that are often upset by later information both the desk and the banks would he better off if the reserve settlement period were extended or carryover privileges were increased so that bank money managers could focus more on their views of which rates would balance underlying supply and demand in the money market and less on the need simply to make reserve settlementsschott federal reserve policy of late 1980 is beginning to bear fruit in realistic prospects for disinflation high interest rates are discouraging borrowing activity even in the commercial real estate market which had been unusually even speculatively active until recentlyvery heavy refinancing demands are in the wings private bond and equity financing is waiting for a chance at balance sheet improvement expected institutional cash flow is sufficient to absorb these offerings but it is essential to keep treasury and agency financing at reasonable levels to provide room for a return to more normal financial ratios in the private sectoroleary the focal point of monetary and other government policies must be that the basic inflation rate is very high and that there is serious danger that it will rise further this year and the expectation of inflation by decisionmakers has not been reduced appreciably if at all by the change in administration much of the traditional longterm fixedrate capital market is fact moving toward shortterm variablerate commitments with this development the result of the expectation of inflation the implications are that until there is real and sustained evidence of effective reduction in inflation there will be a chronic shortage in availability of longterm fixedrate financing and longterm rates will remain very high on any substantial volume of financing
1833,1833,3-25-1981,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,economic activity in the second district continued mixed in february and early march retail sales increased at most stores though a few merchants reported disappointing results domestic car sales picked up a bit at some dealers due in large part to the rebate programs foreign car sales also improved outside the consumer sector economic activity appeared to be generally flat yet a number of respondents did indicate that their companies had experienced a modest improvement in business in recent weeks despite the stronger than expected performance of the national economy in the first quarter the consensus forecast still calls for sluggish growth over 1981 as a whole many respondents expressed enthusiasm for the direction and substance of the new administrations tax and expenditure proposals none however indicated that the proposals had led them to change their own production and capitalspending plans
1834,1834,3-25-1981,New York,Consumer Spending,the february gains in second district retail sales were weaker than during the christmas season but somewhat stronger than in november mild weather and widespread promotional pricecutting accounted for the february pickup generally inventories were reported at satisfactory levels and under continued close surveillanceautomobile sales in the second district strengthened in recent weeks to a large extent however the sales gains have been the result of the substantial rebates offered by domestic car makers yet sales of some imported cars also improved and dealers in these cars anticipate further gains during the spring inventory positions vary greatly some were reported low because of the high cost of carrying inventories while others were described as adequate or high
1835,1835,3-25-1981,New York,The Manufacturing Sector,economic activity in the second district outside the consumer sector was somewhat mixed though many respondents experienced an improved situation in recent weeks a spokesman for the petroleum industry noted a softening of demand compared to a year ago due to greater conservation efforts and warmer weather and some upstate capital goods firms report a continued low level of new orders however moderate pickups in new orders occurred at several firms including a chemical equipment manufacturer that supplies oil refiners a home furniture and furnishings manufacturer and an automotive company in addition a major food company foresees that 1981 will surpass last years record performance a large cosmetics and jewelry manufacturer reports continued gains following an acceleration in sales which began late last year and an industrial equipment manufacturer has experienced strong demand from commercial and industrial construction firms
1836,1836,3-25-1981,New York,Economic Outlook,while several economists saw business activity in the first quarter of 1981 coming in stronger than they had anticipated they have not changed their forecast of a 1 to 112 percent rise in real gnp for the year as a whole retailers anticipate a positive impact on sales during the second half of 1981 resulting from the enactment of president reagans proposed personal income tax cut and some manufacturers expect the rise in defense expenditures to stimulate the economy in general and provide orders for their defenseoriented customers others however expect the nearterm effects of the tax and expenditure cuts to be offsetting the proposed accelerated depreciation program is not expected to have much immediate impact in light of the current low level of capacity utilization and the less than buoyant level of final demand
1837,1837,3-25-1981,New York,Financial Developments,business loan officers at large commercial banks report that business loan demand has been sluggish respondents generally agree that a slowing of economic activity and competition from the commercial paper market have contributed to the weakness in bank loan activity however in the wake of the recent decline in market interest rates relative to the prime respondents reported that belowprime lending has been brisk but very competitive
1838,1838,3-25-1981,New York,Financial Panel,this month we have comments from henry kaufman salomon brothers francis schott equitable life assurance society and albert wojnilower first boston corporation their views are personal not institutionalkaufman a doubledip in economic activity will not occur besides a much larger than expected increase in real gnp this quarter the economic path for the balance of this year will include about 2 percent real growth in the second quarter and 3 to 4 percent for the second half of this year the distinctive features of the continued expansion will include no cyclical support from housing a big increase in defense expenditures prudent business monetary practices constrained by high interest rates and renewed strength on corporate liquidity later this year when interest rates will reach new highs in the long term bond marketsschott prospects for disinflation largely created by welljudged monetary policy are being converted into reality progress will be slow because of the institutionalization of inflation yet psychological factors have turned distinctly favorable for three reasons 1 the administrations expenditure control proposals have credibility including prospects for congressional acceptance 2 federal reserve restraint has resulted in renewed liquidity pressures at intermediaries which is reflected in cautious loan policies and 3 the soft spots in the economy such as housing automobiles and farm machinery have created apprehensions about significant business failures these apprehensions have dampened speculationwojnilower current statistics and reports from business contacts suggest that the economy remains strong and that the reagan program is prompting more expansionary planning by business firms the decline in interest rates likely is setting up a repeat performance of last summers acceleration of business and upsurge in interest ratesbut this time it will be from a stronger base of business activity and without the caution induced by preceding credit stressesindications are that longer term bond issues initially by banks but probably followed by others are accelerating sharply buying of such securities however remains limited largely to pension funds and to fiduciaries and speculators who expect to remain interested in the bond market only very briefly
1889,1889,5-13-1981,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,economic activity in the second district continued to be mixed in april with marked improvement particularly evident in the consumer sector several retailers experienced exceptionally large sales gains and there was strength in some parts of the automobile market while new orders for capital goods remained weak the backlog of unfilled orders has sustained production levels inventories were at acceptable levels in all sectors unexpectedly strong growth in first quarter gnp prompted business economists to revise upward their forecasts of real activity in 1981 slower growth is still expected for the second quarter however followed by a general pickup in the latter half of the year on the financial side activity in the home mortgage market is far below yearearlier levels
1890,1890,5-13-1981,New York,Consumer Spending,retail store sales strengthened significantly in april without unusually heavy promotional activity growth generally was higher than expected at a wide variety of stores throughout the second district one retailer reported that sales grew at twice the rate indicated in the stores plan while yeartoyear comparisons are especially difficult to interpret this month due to last years credit controls transit strike and earlier easter season the 15 to 25 percent gains reported over last april by several stores reflect unusually strong growth apparel merchandise has moved particularly well inventories are somewhat above anticipated levels but are well in line with the higher volume while respondents anticipate continued real growth in sales a repetition of aprils surprising showing seems unlikelythe demand for higherpriced domestic automobiles continued strong while sales of lessexpensive american models remained sluggish dealers attributed weakness of the latter to high prices and high costs of financing meanwhile a dealer of relatively expensive domestic cars reported his third consecutive month of record sales foreign car sales improved but remained weaker than a year ago no inventory problems were indicated
1891,1891,5-13-1981,New York,Manufacturing Sector,manufacturing activity continued mixed in the second district capital goods manufacturers reported a softening of sales but the backlog of unfilled orders helped to maintain production moreover many firms expected orders to pick up later in the year in part because of anticipated changes in business taxation and increases in subcontracts from defense firms activity related to primary and secondary metals appeared to be fairly strong in general inventories were not seen as being out of line although some firms are making adjustments to accommodate anticipated changes in demand for the most part capital spending is proceeding on schedule but some concern over interest rates was voiced
1892,1892,5-13-1981,New York,Financial Developments,an informal survey of 15 of the larger savings and loan associations in new york and new jersey shows that activity in the home mortgage markets is far below yearearlier levels only two of the 15 sls report an active market secured mainly through aggressive advertising and pricing campaigns most associations indicate that many of the customers who apply for mortgages at the average rate of 15 12 percent plus 2 12 to 3 points on fixed rate mortgages do not meet the thrifts income qualifications while rates are slightly lower on flexible rate mortgages they are not as low as the 14 12 percent rate that one organization cited as the threshold level for an active market approximately onehalf of the sls surveyed offer both fixed rate and variable rate mortgages onefourth offer only fixed rates and the remaining onefourth offer only variable rates
1893,1893,5-13-1981,New York,Economic Outlook,several business economists have increased their real gnp growth forecasts for 1981 by about a percentage point to 2  2 12 percent nonetheless doubt was expressed that real gnp growth in the first quarter was as high as the preliminary estimate of 6 12 percent for the second quarter slower or no real growth is forecast with gradual improvement to follow proposed tax cuts may boost consumer sales but there was concern that continued volatility and high levels of interest rates may depress credit sales
1894,1894,5-13-1981,New York,Financial Panel,comments this month are from james j oleary united states trust company of new york francis h schott equitable life assurance company and albert m wojnilower first boston corporation their views are personal not institutionaloleary with a clash between forces toward a stronger expansion in real output with continued high inflation and monetary policy aimed at squeezing down the expansion of money supply both short term interest rates and longterm rates are likely to remain very high through 1982 the expectation that inflation will remain high and that interest rates will remain high and volatile is drying up the availability of funds for the purchase of longterm fixedrate bonds and mortgages borrowers are thus forced to continue to borrow shortterm much of it in the commercial banks with the effect of giving an upward bias to the expansion of the money supply should interest rates on average remain high and credit tight for an extended periodsay through 1982there will be a severe crisis for many thrift institutions and probably for some life insurance companies the need to place greater weight on fiscal restraint to help the monetary authorities is greatschott the financial market reaction to the strength of the economy and the runup in the money supply figures is exaggerated and likely to be short lived although it is understandable borrowers and investors alike are uncertain how much additional interest rate fluctuation is going to be induced by strict emphasis on monetary aggregates hence there is precautionary borrowing and great reluctance to lend in the face of possible further major disintermediationthe level of interest rates is excessive relative to business conditions and underlying inflation there will be a correction as soon as the money aggregates return to roughly target levelswojnilower the current business situation appears flat and slightly up businessmen except in the housing and auto industries are virtually unanimous in their optimism about the short and long run business outlook financial markets are more than ever preoccupied with day to day swings in security prices
1945,1945,6-30-1981,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,economic activity in the second district was again mixed in late may and early june department store sales continued to be strong with most chains reporting sales moderately above plan there has been a partial recovery from the postrebate automobile sales slump but lowerpriced models remain particularly weak manufacturing activity was varied with strength in steel production for example but with further weakness in machine tool orders business economists still look for little real gnp growth for the next two quarters on the financial side the proportion of shortterm commercial loans issued on a variablerate basis is increasing
1946,1946,6-30-1981,New York,Consumer Spending,the unexpected strength of department store sales generally continued into june sales gains extended to most product lines and to stores throughout the district apparel sales were especially strong as in the past several months there was a great deal of promotional activity the outlook for the near term is optimistic especially when a tax cut is taken into account although one respondent worried that the current strength might be coming at the expense of sales later in the year some chains are adjusting their plans and inventories upwardautomobile sales showed modest improvement over the postrebate slump but are still running well below 1980 levels high loan rates and recent price rises were most commonly cited for the sluggish performance a dealer of lessexpensive domestic cars reported the worst june for new cars in his history a foreign car dealer reported that lowerpriced lines are not selling at all although the demand for higherpriced models remains strong the brisk pace of used car sales was taken by one industry specialist as a harbinger of future strength of new car sales inventories generally are being kept as low as possible because of high interest rates
1947,1947,6-30-1981,New York,Manufacturing Sector,manufacturing activity remained mixed in recent weeks upstate steel production rose sharply to the highest level since september 1979 but a major paper products firm reported weakness across all product lines the respondents in the capital goods sector indicated an overall deterioration of demand requiring a decrease in production as backlogs have begun to fall none of the firms which were surveyed reported any curtailment of their ongoing capital spending programs however high interest rates were said to be discouraging some new projects at this time there was little evidence that price pressures were abating firms look forward to possible tax cuts but as yet they have not acted on their expectations
1948,1948,6-30-1981,New York,Economic Outlook,despite the unexpectedly large first quarter real gnp growth announced since the last survey the consensus of business economists continues to be for little real growth for the next quarter or two some respondents look for improvement if and when tax cuts are enacted but even the most optimistic do not foresee any signs of recovery until late in the year forecasts for specific industries vary a major conglomerate is projecting strength in plastics chemicals and energy products while a large oil producer expects national demand for oil to continue to be weak there have been some signs that inflation is abating one analyst suggested that the growth in consumer spending may cool if the inflationary buyinadvance psychology abates
1949,1949,6-30-1981,New York,Financial Developments,floating rate pricing schemes have become standard offering at large commercial banks according to senior loan officers at major second district banks most shortterm commercial loans are being issued on variablerate basis floating rate loans are generally made at the prime rate or at a markup over that rate when the prime rate is changed the rates on these loans are automatically changed the loans are prepayable without penalty and usually have maturities of 60 90 or 180 days
1950,1950,6-30-1981,New York,Financial Panel,comments this month are from henry kaufman salomon brothers donald riefler morgan guaranty trust and robert stone irving trust their views are personal not institutionalkaufman the sluggish economic pace will continue through the summer months but will he followed by a sharp snapback in the fourth quarter while the rate of inflation has slowed it should be noted there are transitory aspects to this improvement including the cyclical improvement in productivity a good agricultural crop this year and the tight inventory posture of business in the financial sector business corporations are again missing the ability to fund an adequate volume of shortterm indebtedness they will be pressed with greater urgency to enter the longterm market in the next twelve months at interest rate levels that were unacceptable just a year ago the most vulnerable sector of the fixedincome bond market during the year ahead is likely to be the municipal market a series of developments are highly unfavorable to this market these include tax reductions the potential issuance of partially tax exempt certificates of deposit the reduction of grants and aid by the federal government to state and local governments the very limited buying of taxexempts by commercial banks and the advent of spread bankingriefler inflationary expectations have dropped the fed should therefore tolerate lower levels of interest rates however rates should not be allowed to drop so rapidly and so far that the policy would have to be reversed later in the year it is important that this be the last peak in ratesstone while the economy will experience little or no real growth in the second quarter the prospect in our view is for a resumption of moderate 4 percent or so growth in the second half we also anticipate further reductions in inflation rates and in inflationary expectations against this background and in view of the recent behavior of the monetary aggregates it is my opinion that the time has come for the fed to relax slightly the grip in which it is holding the banks at the discount window thus i suggest provision of nonborrowed reserves such that borrowings for the next three to four weeks center around 15 billion or thereabouts followed after that interval by another slight relaxation to the 12 billion area should aggregates then be behaving in a satisfactory waythis course would reduce the chances of a material undershoot of m1b over the next couple of months and by the moderate nature of the relaxation would minimize the chances of laying the background for substantial overshoot later
2008,2008,8-11-1981,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,economic activity in the second district weakened a bit in july retail sales slowed from the brisk pace of previous months and automobile demand remained fairly lackluster new orders for capital goods continued to taper off the strength of the dollar is worrying exporters but so far few specific comments on export sales losses have been picked up the overall economic outlook is mixed while personal tax cuts are expected to boost department store sales by the end of 1981 automobile sales and capital spending are expected to remain weak until interest rates fall significantly on the financial side major banks reported substantial increases in levels of credit lines intended for merger activity
2009,2009,8-11-1981,New York,Consumer Spending,in july retail activity in the second district fell from the generally high levels of may and june while several department store chains indicated that sales were at or above plan performances at all retail stores were weaker than those of last month sales in the new york city stores were slower than in their suburban counterparts in contrast to previous months when no geographic pattern emerged the slackening in the overall sales pace has caused no change in plans as respondents speculated that seasonal factors and the timing of holiday promotions were partly responsiblethe demand for automobiles showed little change in july domestic cars sold at slightly above last years lackluster pace and foreign cars again sold poorly lowerpriced lines continued to be weaker than moreexpensive models high prices and high interest rates were blamed for the poor performance of auto sales while hope was expressed that manufacturers rebate and financecharge promotions would stimulate demand the tax cuts were not expected to provide much help
2010,2010,8-11-1981,New York,Manufacturing Activity,weakness of capital spending persisted in july all capital goods producers in the survey reported that new orders fell below junes depressed levels although the backlogs at some firms have been used to shore up production levels one machinetool manufacturer remarked that the firm s current threemonth slowdown is the first in two years a steel plant much of whose output normally goes to the automobile industry was said to be operating at a pretty good rate nevertheless capital allocations to this plant are being reduced because it is not as profitable as others located outside the district
2011,2011,8-11-1981,New York,Exchange Rate Effects on Exports,for some time now we have been hearing general comments from business leaders to the effect that the strong dollar poses a threat to exports the only specifics however have been on the one hand that most us industries do not really feel the impact of exchange rate changes for two or three years but on the other that export orders for chemicals are already being unfavorably affectedan informal survey of 10 large manufacturing firms conducted for this meeting brought out that so far there has been only a small adverse effect on export sales from the higher foreign currency exchange value of the dollar the preponderant view was that it was still too early to assess the full impact of the dollars appreciation although several companies have lost export sales especially in europe most believe that the export losses stem from a slowdown in economic activity abroad rather than the dollars appreciation however two indicated that higher foreign currency prices for their exports have resulted in lower sales to europe and they seemed concerned about greater losses in the near future
2012,2012,8-11-1981,New York,Economic Outlook,the outlook for the next twelve months is mixed some retailers look forward to continued strength while others anticipate further weakness until the end of the year the majority of business economists see a flattoweak third quarter although one is predicting 18 percent real gnp growth while economists and retailers in our survey expect the tax cuts to stimulate consumer spending by the first quarter of 1982 auto industry respondents anticipate little help one corporate economist however sees the tax cut helping car sales late in the year none of the respondents foresee business tax cuts boosting capital spending soon the prospective strengthening in capital spending is seen as beginning as early as mid1982 or as late as 1984 gnp forecasts for 1982 indicate about 3 percent real growth
2013,2013,8-11-1981,New York,Financial Developments,officials at six major new york city banks reported substantial increases in the volume of credit lines intended for merger activity most of these commitments are for unsecured loans with maturities ranging from three to twelve years a majority of the banks interviewed offer various pricing options on the loans while the others charge the prime rate it is not uncommon for about forty to fifty banks to be involved in the syndications with a significant portion of the total dollar commitment twenty five to fiftyfive percent provided by foreign banks some officials said that restrictions on the amount of money that may be lent to a single entity had limited the participation of us banks in these syndicates none of the officials interviewed anticipated any difficulty in funding these loans if and when they are taken down and for this reason they did not expect to have to reduce credit availability elsewhere
2014,2014,8-11-1981,New York,Financial Panel,this month we have comments from james oleary u s trust company and donald riefler morgan guaranty trust company their views of course are personal not institutionaloleary the forces behind the upward movement of interest rates this year are 1 the continuing strong fear that the decline in the inflation rate is only temporary 2 continuing very strong private shortterm business credit demand caused importantly by the fact that longterm debt markets are still closed down 3 the determination of the fed to persist in its policy 4 the impact of high shortterm rates on the cash flow of life insurance companies and the thrifts 5 heavy us treasury financing and 6 a huge backlog of demand for longterm fixedrate financingthe course that the federal reserve and the financial markets are now on threatens a mass failure of the thrifts which would undoubtedly cause a tremendous shock to the economy and would present very serious problems for public policythere are risks in a fed move to relax creditand there are risks in not doing so there is no easy choice at this point my own rather uncertain judgment is that a modest and guarded relaxation would be the wisest course of policy i think the financial markets would understand and accept a moderate and careful relaxation of credit without concluding that inflation is off to the races again this paragraph was written before i saw the recent comments of secretary reganriefler concern about the thrift industry is growing as market expectations for significantly lower interest rates are waning we see evidence that savings bank deposit withdrawals are on the increase concern about other credit problems persist and the passage of a few months time at these interest rate levels will probably bring more distress situations to the surface the fed should watch these developments carefully and be ready to adjust to any surprises that may occur
2080,2080,9-30-1981,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,economic activity in the second district remained sluggish in august and september the retail sector showed limited signs of recovery department store sales recouped some of julys decline and rebate and interest rate subsidy programs spurred automobile sales lackluster conditions persisted in manufacturing industries with high financing costs said to be discouraging new orders business economists do not anticipate any gains in real gnp until the end of the year despite small reductions in the prime rate they expect real gnp to grow between 25 percent and 3 percent in 1982 on the financial side consumer resistance to upward adjustment on renegotiablerate mortgages was evident
2081,2081,9-30-1981,New York,Consumer Spending,in august and september retail activity in the second district rebounded somewhat from the onemonth drop that occurred in july while the fall season began slowly due to the late labor day and school openings most department stores are now achieving their sales goals products for the home exhibited weakness with a retailer attributing the softening to the appreciation of the dollar and consequent falloff in tourism and foreign business merchants believe the rest of the year will be good national retailers reported that sales in the new york area were generally healthier than in other parts of the country in contrast to the relative strength of suburban locations evident in july city and suburban stores are now performing equally well none of the establishments foresaw any need to cut their inventoriesautomobile sales improved in august matching the previous year levels which most of the dealers considered respectable strength appeared in both domestic and foreign automobile lines and across the price and size spectrums rebate and interest rate subsidy programs were credited for the upturn dealers expect a slowdown with the expiration of these programs the higher prices of the new 1982 models could depress sales further inventories are at acceptable to low levels as the higher activity removed the excesses existing in prior months the used car market has remained strong and truck sales have picked up
2082,2082,9-30-1981,New York,Manufacturing Activity,weakness in manufacturing industries lingered into september new orders received by capital goods producers stayed at the low levels of july though one firm recorded an additional 40 percent to 50 percent decline consequently some companies have laid off workers and cut production from already contracted rates many businesses indicated that high interest costs have caused customers to defer purchases and reduce inventories two establishments noted an increase in returned items as clients sought to avoid payments none of the respondents expected any immediate upswing and even defense contractors were uncertain whether rising national defense expenditures would result in much new businesssome firms have reacted to the sluggish activity by trimming inventories of final output even to the extent of eliminating less profitable product lines one concern has maintained sales by cutting prices but its growth has fallen to a fraction of the earlier pace companies are trying to proceed with planned capital spending especially in high technology industries such as electronics these expenditures are seen as essential to protect competitive positions increases in capital spending due to recent tax changes are not yet apparent negotiations on wage settlements are easing as job security is being emphasized over pay hikes
2083,2083,9-30-1981,New York,Economic Outlook,business economists foresee no growth or a small drop in real gnp during the third quarter and a flat fourth quarter real growth in gnp during 1982 is expected to be in the 25 percent to 3 percent range as some economists have revised their forecasts downward interest rate projections indicate a prime rate of 17 percent to 18 percent by the end of the year a more modest fall from current levels than some previous estimates in reaction to a sluggish economy the inflation rate is predicted to decelerate through 1982
2084,2084,9-30-1981,New York,Financial Developments,in recent years a number of mortgage instruments containing rate adjustment provisions have been adopted by mortgage lenders the paucity of experience with rate adjustments on these loans magnifies the importance of a recent episode in upstate new york buffalo savings bank recently abandoned plans to raise the rates on callable loans written in 1975 and 1976 from 85 percent to 14 percent the loans had been made at belowmarket rates because of a binding usury ceiling which has since been removed in response to the public outcry the bank extended the 85 percent rate for the full 25 or 30 year amortization periods of the loans
2085,2085,9-30-1981,New York,Financial Panel,this month we have comments from francis schott equitable life insurance company robert stone irving trust company and albert wojnilower first boston corporationschott longterm financial markets are seriously depressed disintermediation is once again impeding the supply of institutional funds but high shortterm rates have only very recently become a deterrent to the use of shortterm credit for longterm needs federal reserve credibility is growing month by month as long as he move toward ease is very slight and aggregate targets are observed i see no viable alternative to this welljudged policystone the shortrun aim of policy at this juncture should i think be to maintain a posture such that interest rates continue to decline gradually to levels that would permit moderate real economic growth and that would not threaten significant undershoots or overshoots in the aggregates in my view the tactic most likely to achieve that result would be to provide nonborrowed reserves such that basic borrowings those exclusive of seasonal borrowings and extended credit be maintained in the general area of 600 to 900 million to go much below that range for an extended period would in my view risk a troublesome overshootthe last thing anyone wants under present circumstanceswojnilower business activity is weakening on a broad scale and this is beginning to affect investment planning there is no reduction whatsoever in credit availability for large companies even those of lower credit quality the presidents speech in my judgment will probably have a negative impact in practical terms cutting the budget will intensify rather than ameliorate economic and financial problems nevertheless i still expect some modest upturn in the economy by year end our people believe that the tax benefit transfer provisions of the new tax law will have the result that many major companies will pay no corporate profits tax at all for several years
2145,2145,11-10-1981,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the sluggishness in the second district became more widespread during october the retail sector worsened as department store gains tapered off and automobile dealers reported bleak conditions manufacturing industries remained depressed our directors reported a sharp deterioration in business conditions nationwide with the weakening spreading beyond housing and autos to basic industries in general and retail sales acrosstheboard on the financial side demand for business loans was high due to cash shortages and a poor bond market
2146,2146,11-10-1981,New York,Consumer Spending,in october growth in retail activity in the second district slowed from the modest rise in august and september while many stores in the new york region outperformed those in many other areas of the country few local retailers achieved their goals a slackening national economy with rising unemployment and high interest rates was blamed for the downturn slow sales have led to somewhat inflated inventories expectations regarding holiday business ranged from cautious hopes to outright pessimismautomobile sales slumped in october as rebate and interest rate subsidy programs expired even the previously strong market for used cars showed some signs of weakening floor traffic has dwindled as potential buyers worry about uncertainty in the economic outlook and high interest costs dealers attempting to minimize carrying charges are paring inventories and reducing factor orders no improvement is anticipated before january as the holiday months of november and december traditionally are slow
2147,2147,11-10-1981,New York,Manufacturing Activity,manufacturing activity remained depressed during october capital goods producers reported that sales shipments and new orders have generally stabilized at the low levels of prior months only one firm mentioned any additional drop backlogs have enabled some establishments to maintain production but at the current rate at which these past orders are being filled cutbacks will occur soon electronics and defense companies also experienced flat or slightly dampened sales but one firm noted high demand for its aerospace products a number of producers reported declining profits or actual lossesstringent control of inventories was widespread two companies have trimmed raw materials supplies while others are tightening inventories of workinprogress desire for cuts in stocks of finished goods was expressed but in some cases slow sales have prevented a rapid adjustment to lower levels despite slow activity some businesses seem reluctant to curb capital spending but others emphasized only sluggishness aheadplans for sizable layoffs by a major upstate manufacturer of office equipment suggest that unemployment in some localities may jump many concerns are relying on attrition and careful hiring practices to hold employment down poor economic conditions have moderated wage increases for firms not locked into preexisting contracts
2148,2148,11-10-1981,New York,Economic Outlook,the outlook of our business directors changed from waitandsee to outright gloom the weakness has now spread to all basic industries and while high technology industries and services may be holding up they fear a serious recession is in the making the weakening in retail sales of department stores and mass merchandisers have left inventories at undesirably high levels and the outlook for holiday sales has turned quite uneasy other respondents were less pessimistic with the fourth quarter flat to slightly down and moderate growth23 percentforeseen for 1982 these respondents current projections indicate the prime rate could fall to the 14 percent to 16 percent range by the end of the year a larger drop than was anticipated in september the inflation outlook is unchanged with an 8 percent to 9 percent cpi expected for 1982 as a whole
2149,2149,11-10-1981,New York,Financial Developments,senior lending officials at the major new york city banks generally reported strong demand for business loans in the month of october the major reasons cited for the firm loan demand were the deterioration of the longterm bond market and the dwindling cash flow of corporations it was noted that inventory financing has not been excessive and is unlikely to create any problems in the near future during the coming months credit demand is expected to soften slightly as business activity declines however in anticipation of a short recession bank officers also expect lending activity to pick up by the beginning of next year
2150,2150,11-10-1981,New York,Financial Panel,this month we have comments from james oleary us trust company and donald riefler morgan guaranty trust companyoleary virtually all of the economic indicators are now confirming that general business activity is worsening high interest rates are biting federal reserve policy is on the right course there is room for the authorities to encourage a stronger rate of increase in m1b and a continuing decline of shortterm rates but such a move should be carried out with great care so that it will be perceived as being within the framework of maintaining a steady policy position and not one that aggressively expands money supply to head off a serious recession i anticipate a further significant decline of shortterm rates in the next few months which would be healthy if it does not go too far as it did during the second quarter of 1980 it would surprise me however if longterm rates declined very much in any lasting way during the next several months due to the fact that the supply of funds for the purchase of longterm fixedrate bonds and mortgages is not apt to be large enough to satisfy the huge backed up demands for such financingriefler a marked shift in sentiment has occurred and we now expect negative real growth for at least this quarter recovery may be slow because longterm interest rates will probably remain quite high in relation to underlying conditions the fed should continue its current policy along gradual easing of shortterm ratesany abrupt changes could be counterproductive by arousing fears of a rapid reversal such as was witnessed in the fall of 1980 and the spring of this year
2209,2209,12-16-1981,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,economic activity remained sluggish in the second district during november with some further softening evident retail activity unexpectedly slowed before thanksgiving but has since recovered somewhat poor conditions persisted in manufacturing and additional weakening in capital goods orders was observed residential construction continued to be depressed but a falloff in nonresidential construction contracts was believed to be temporary business economists now expect sizable declines in real gnp during the fourth quarter and no real pickup until the second quarter or half of 1982 on the financial side mergers acquisitions and cash shortages pushed up the demand for business loans
2210,2210,12-16-1981,New York,Consumer Spending,retail activity virtually stopped growing in early november with some department stores experiencing a drop in business the pace has quickened since thanksgiving but most retailers are still slightly below plan since the bulk of christmas buying has been occurring later in the season in recent years merchants are hopeful that the pickup in sales will continue producing a reasonably good holiday season overall many stores are depending on heavy promotions and price markdowns to spur sales all respondents expressed serious concern about january and beyond
2211,2211,12-16-1981,New York,Manufacturing Activity,manufacturing activity remained depressed during november with further weakening reported by some firms after appearing to bottom out during september and october new orders received by capital goods producers declined again although one capital goods supplier maintained output by depleting its backlog all others cut production levels workforces have been reduced through layoffs or attrition one establishment however preferred to retain highly skilled employees and to add the excess output to its inventories capital spending by many of these producers of durable equipment has been lowered and in one instance stopped altogetherother manufacturers also experienced flat or slightly lower sales even the previously strong demand for data processing equipment has slipped the only increase in business was reported by a company whose aerospace division received a large quantity of new defense contracts businesses are adjusting to the bleak situation with stringent cost controls the elimination of internal inefficiencies and in one case a restructuring of pricing policies to curtail price cutting competition
2212,2212,12-16-1981,New York,Construction and Home Sales,construction activity continues to be very low in the residential sector and strong in the nonresidential sector home sales are down from octobers poor level high financing costs are blamed for the sluggish activity in the residential area recent declines in interest rates have not yet improved conditions any gains that do occur are expected to be modest and temporary as for nonresidential construction a drop in the value of contracts let in new york city is viewed as only temporary major projects such as battery park city are scheduled to begin soon and the new work should be sufficient to sustain a high rate of office construction activity
2213,2213,12-16-1981,New York,Economic Outlook,business economists have revised their forecasts of economic growth sharply downward a dismal fourth quarter is expected to yield a real gnp decline as large as 7 percent followed by negligible growth at best during the first quarter of 1982 manufacturers generally agree with this outlook anticipating no significant upswing in business until the second quarter or later overall growth for next year is estimated to be one percent or lower by all but one economist the prime rate is projected to average 14 percent during the coming year the 1982 inflation outlook is unchanged from the 8 to 9 percent level forecast last month
2214,2214,12-16-1981,New York,Financial Developments,lending officers at commercial banks report that there have been moderate to significant increases in demands for business loans during recent weeks mergers and acquisitions were an important source of the increased demand as was the greaterthanexpected deterioration of corporate cash flows a related source of the strength in loan demands has been the need to finance unintended inventory accumulations while demands for bank loans have been strong the growth of commercial paper outstanding has been sluggish although rates on commercial paper are appreciably below the posted prime rate bank borrowing demands have remained strong because of the flexibility of such borrowing arrangements and the widespread use of belowprime lending facilities
2215,2215,12-16-1981,New York,Financial Panel,this month we have comments from francis schott equitable life assurance robert stone irving trust and albert wojnilower first boston corporationschott institutional money flows are beginning to improve under the influence of lower interest rates but demand for longterm funds is very heavy partly in order to improve liquidity ratios and partly to finance investment projects especially in energy therefore long rates may stay relatively highfinancial markets are less concerned with fiscal 82 federal deficit than with the grim prospects for fiscal 83 and 84 money growth targets and fiscal prospects are viewed as clashing with the private sector the likely victimstone by letting borrowings get so low the fed has effectively severed the connection between the discount rate and the federal funds rate the funds rate will nevertheless hold up in december if only because of the seasonal strength in short term credit demands but when these demands subside in january for seasonal and perhaps for cyclical reasons as well short term rates could fall sharply such a drop in rates could well be followed by a surge in the aggregates at what might be a most unpropitious timerecent increases in aggregates should push required reserves up and i believe the fed should respond by letting enough borrowings emerge to reestablish the connection between the discount rate and the funds rate enough borrowing for this purpose are 500600 million exclusive of seasonal borrowings and extended credit once that connection is reestablished the fed can again do what it did so effectively over the past two or three monthslead the rate structure downward at its own pace by periodic reductions in the discount rateby this means the fed is most likely to achieve the objective of lowering interest rates while minimizing the risk of a serious overshoot in the aggregatewojnilower such indications as i am able to gather from business contacts support the view that the business decline may soon slow materially this prospect coupled with apparent acceleration of monetary growth is roiling the bond market severe securities market repercussions are to be expected if average federal funds rates were to rise
2274,2274,1-27-1982,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,economic activity in the second district remained sluggish through the end of the year few respondents reported a further decline but none believed that an upturn had begun for retailers the christmas season ended on a surprisingly strong note though with the recent bad weather sales have fallen off substantially manufacturing activity continued generally weak with some firms cutting their work forces and capital spending the only industry reporting additional declines in orders however was capital goods manufacturing conditions in the construction industry remained mixed with the housing market still depressed and the nonresidential market buoyant looking to 1982 most business economists expect a first quarter decline followed by a consumer led recovery in the spring on the financial side the demand for business loans stayed high
2275,2275,1-27-1982,New York,Consumer Spending,after a slow start the holiday selling season picked up momentum with a surprisingly strong surge as christmas approached and most department stores wound up exceeding their december goals while merchants were worried that prechristmas promotions and markdowns would cut into january sales inclement weather has proved to be a more serious problem causing business to drop sharply at most establishments according to the retailers contacted only a small proportion of these weatherrelated sales losses are likely to be recouped nevertheless inventories are generally considered to be in satisfactory condition and respondents have become less pessimistic about the near future
2276,2276,1-27-1982,New York,Manufacturing,manufacturing remained depressed but there was some evidence that the bottom may be near electronics firms reported that sales had stabilized at a low level or increased slightly and some other companies recorded small gains in orders a manufacturer of aerospace equipment cited strong demand from the defense sector again this month only producers of machinery and machine tools experienced additional deterioration in demandwork forces were reduced further by some concerns through attrition or layoffs despite press reports of widespread moderation of wage demands the only respondent engaged in labor negotiations reported aggressive bargaining by its union other businessmen from upstate new york noted examples of wage settlements near 10 percent businesses have become more selective in their capital spending and a few have trimmed their plans inventories have generally been held to desired levels
2277,2277,1-27-1982,New York,Real Estate Activity,construction activity continued to be very low in the residential sector yet generally strong in the nonresidential sector homebuilders were still reluctant to begin work without a signed order in hand sales of existing homes remained stalled except for those in the very high priced bracket housing prices were reported to have softened as for nonresidential construction one major project recently got under way in new york city and plans for others are apparently proceeding normally also in new york city conversion of industrial lofts to office uses has not abated in suburban areas the healthy rate of commercial construction was maintained although developers were relying increasingly on joint ventures among themselves to overcome financing difficulties
2278,2278,1-27-1982,New York,Economic Outlook,business economists continue to forecast a small decline in real gnp during the first quarter of 1982 most feel that stronger consumer spending will fuel a modest rebound as early as the spring anticipated declines in interest rates are expected to spur investment housing and the automobile industry adding momentum to the recovery if interest rates do not fall however the upswing will likely be delayed according to the respondents inflation projections have been lowered about a percentage point with a 7 to 8 percent rise now predicted for 1982
2279,2279,1-27-1982,New York,Financial Developments,lending officers at the major new york city banks reported that last months moderate to heavy demand for business loans has not subsided commercial and industrial loans booked at international banking facilities ibfs added to the growth although the sluggish economy has restrained overall credit demand shortterm bank loans are expected to remain strong as long as longterm bond rates are high corporate mergers have contributed to the steady activity at some banks
2280,2280,1-27-1982,New York,Financial Panel,this month we have comments from david jones aubrey g lanston  co james oleary uw trust and donald riefler morgan guaranty their views of course are personal and not institutionaljones the financial markets are in a highly unsettled state and nearterm conditions are likely to get worse before they get better contributing to this volatile market environment are growing uncertainties over nearterm federal reserve policy intentions increases in the federal funds rate are serving to destabilize the bond market and to push longer term rates back up to record levels adding to the market gloom are prospects for continued heavy federal government borrowing at the same time shortterm business credit demand remains puzzlingly strongperhaps reflecting unintended inventory accumulation liquidity strains and the inability to fund already excessive shortterm debt in the bond market the result could be an intensifying credit crunch for all but the most creditworthy business borrowers and for state and local governmentsoleary the national economy is in a trap caused by the inflation of the past sixteen years with the expectations it has created and the federal deficit the huge deficit for this year and apparently for years to come negates the helpful influence which the financial markets should be receiving from the promising decline in the core inflation rate volatility in the markets is bound to continue with long rates on average remaining very high any recovery is apt to be weak and short lived and for the foreseeable future growth is almost certain to be very low at best and unemployment very high this spells rising political pressure on the fed to pour money into the economy which would be a disaster the only basic way out is a major change in policy which will offer real assurance that this year and beyond the federal deficit will be reduced to more reasonable levelsriefler loan demand has shown some signs of tapering off at morgan guaranty since the peak was reached late in november although we continue to view the economy as weak we are reassured by the feds relative quick resistance to excessive monetary growth and believe this will have a positive effect on longerterm fixed income markets we do not believe that shortterm rates are headed back to 198081 highs but are keeping our fingers crossed
2343,2343,3-23-1982,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,economic activity in the second district remained sluggish during february and early march among retailers sales activity was uneven residential construction continued to be depressed but nonresidential activity was still thriving conditions in the manufacturing sector were generally lackluster reports from upstate new york indicate that a number of small companies have abandoned their expansion plans while some machine tool companies have been hit by cancellations in backlogged orders high technology firms however were the exception to the prevailing weakness in manufacturing proving relatively resistant to the national downturn overall labor market conditions were comparatively strong new york states unemployment rate has been less than the nations and its unemployment insurance claims have been below those of a year ago looking ahead respondents saw neither a turnaround nor a further decline in the nations economy as imminent
2344,2344,3-23-1982,New York,Consumer Spending,retail activity in the second district was uneven during february and the first half of march sales at both department stores and discount chains ranged from below plan to at or above plan in upstate new york there have been some store closings and earlier weatherrelated losses have not been recouped inventory levels were comfortable at most stores most of the merchants even those who have had belowplan sales in recent months tended to be cautiously optimistic in their outlook for spring
2345,2345,3-23-1982,New York,Real Estate and Construction Activity,conditions varied widely in the construction sector activity in the residential market continued to be minimal as high financing costs and economic uncertainty discouraged potential buyers creative financing has done little to stimulate sales homebuilders noted that demand for high density housing remains strong though zoning obstacles are preventing such construction in many areas the building of highpriced homes by prior contract accounted for virtually all activityin contrast the nonresidential construction boom has not abated and is expected to continue into 1983 in manhattan a shortage of office space has pushed vacancy rates to record lows although office rental prices are now rising much more slowly than a few months ago in suburban areas earlier industrial and corporate growth has fueled a similar expansion in office space hotel and motel construction in the district was also strong although in manhattan this construction has been tapering off
2346,2346,3-23-1982,New York,Labor Markets and Business Activity,the consensus of business leaders and government officials around the region was that new york state was weathering the recession quite well all those contacted expressed surprise at how well the regional economy has held up and mentioned the diversification in the state economy into high technology industries as one of the primary contributing factors despite some pockets of extreme joblessness the unemployment rate was less that the nations and unemployment insurance claims were below those of a year ago according to a state labor official much of the increase in unemployment which has occurred is the result of the difficulties which new entrants and reentrants to the labor force have had finding jobs rather than from what is commonly expected during a recessionincreased separations of experienced workersnevertheless some industries have been deeply affected by the recession as in the nation layoffs and reduced hours are widespread among steel automobile automobile supply and machine tool firms as an example of the problems facing the machine tool industry one upstate company was hit by a large number of cancellations of backlogged orders in addition a number of smaller firms were reported to have abandoned their spring expansion plansas for the future local business leaders and government officials saw no imminent signs of an economic turnaround but neither did they think that conditions were going to get much worse respondents were uncertain about the direction of interest rates the impact of personal income tax cuts and the effects of safeharbor leasing provisions
2347,2347,3-23-1982,New York,Financial Panel,this month we have comments from henry kaufman solomon bros donald maude merrill lynch and robert stone irving trust their views of course are personal not institutionalkaufman the economy will begin to experience real economic growth sometime this spring but the recovery will be of subcyclical proportion the financial backdrop will not support a strong and sustained business recovery business liquidity continues to deteriorate profits will remain under extreme pressure while no balance sheet restructuring has materialized during this recession many additional downgradings of business credit ratings are likely to be announced in the forthcoming months interest rates will continue to be highly volatile the longterm bond markets in particular will be challenged by a lack of liquidity in business the huge treasury cash needs and a firm monetary policymaude most likely developments over the spring and early summer months should place renewed severe upward pressure on interest rates with longterm yields retesting their 1981 highs in a financial crisis type environment these developments should manifest themselves in the form of a highly anemic economic recovery some modest pickup in private credit demands a cash flow squeeze in the nonfinancial corporate sector continued strains on financial intermediaries credit quality concerns and a reluctance on the part of investors to make longterm fixed income commitments the underlying causes of these difficulties should be an april and july surge in money growth a resulting monetary tightening huge actual treasury financing especially during the third quarter and continued apprehension over the outyear budgetary deficitsstone it is our view that the economy has probably touched bottom and that a few months of relatively slow growth lies ahead while lower interest rates are urgently needed it would be a mistake for the system to take overt action to reduce them until mi has remained within the target range for several weeks accordingly it seems to me that in the period ahead the fed should continue to provide non borrowed reserves such that basic borrowings borrowings net of seasonal and extended credit come out in the general range of 800 to 1200 million
2410,2410,5-12-1982,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,economic activity in the second district remained lackluster during april major retailers reported that consumer spending was weaker than expected new residential construction continued to languish although some brokers noted a few signs of modest improvement nonresidential building was still brisk but there was softening in the office rental market widespread layoffs were noted in the manufacturing sector except for the defense industry few firms experienced any increase in new orders while the regions unemployment rate remained below the nations business leaders expressed growing concern that the recession would spread to more sectors of the regions economy
2411,2411,5-12-1982,New York,Consumer Spending,retail activity in the second district was weak during april as most department stores failed to meet plans which had been considered to be conservative business appears to be getting tougher for many retailers one symptom is the increasingly widespread use of markdowns and promotional activity another symptom is the greater difficulty we have had in getting retailers to return our phone calls one retailer who works for a department store in new york city which caters to a welltodo clientele told us that this was the most difficult period in his memory while apparel housewares and other nondurable goods were reportedly doing all right such things as sporting goods horticultural items and bigticket products were selling poorly despite lagging sales inventories at most stores were at acceptable levels retailersperennial optimists that they areremain hopeful about their prospects for the second half of the year expecting their sales to improve in response to the july tax cut
2412,2412,5-12-1982,New York,Construction and Real Estate Activity,residential construction remained depressed but there were a few signs of modest improvement in the housing market in new york city a broker reported that sales of existing homes in queens increased markedly he attributed the gains to wider acceptance of high but renegotiable interest rates in manhattan a continued influx of very wealthy buyers frequently paying cash maintained high demand for luxury cooperative apartments in suburban areas a better understanding of buy downs was helping to bolster salesnonresidential construction activity remained strong with work continuing on many new office buildings at the same time however the rental market for office space has softened throughout the district perhaps foreshadowing a future falloff in new construction projects in new york city for example landlords granted more concessions to prospective tenants including slower escalation of rents and more structural improvements space available for subleasing rose significantly as firms which had been holding the space deferred expansion plans one justcompleted building had been entirely preleased a year ago but almost a third of its space was again available outside of new york city rents also stabilized and in western connecticut leasing during the first quarter was the lowest in five years respondents believed however that the slowdown was only temporary
2413,2413,5-12-1982,New York,Business Activity,the district continues to weather the recession relatively well with the regions unemployment rate holding steady in april at a level below the nations the manufacturing sector however has been deeply affected by the recession layoffs were widespread with only scattered recalls except for the defense industry few firms reported any pickup in orders indeed capital goods producers in western new york experienced further cancellations a producer of traffic and airport lights shortened its workweek apparently because cuts in state and local spending dampened public sector demand a list of new capital projects compiled by the new york state department of commerce indicated that fewer major projects are being undertaken this year than last
2414,2414,5-12-1982,New York,Outlook,as we found last month few respondents outside of retailing expect a general economic recovery to begin soon most expressed growing concern that the recession would spread to more sectors of the regions economy including business services the gloomiest assessment came from a business leader in western new york who did not foresee any turnaround there for another two years many observers were disturbed by talk of further bankruptcies in the manufacturing sector if conditions did not improve soon almost all respondents believed that a fall in interest rates was essential for a recovery however one port authority official did point to a recent increase in piggyback rail traffic as a possible sign of an incipient upturnas for the price outlook there was little feel for whether the recent price slowdown was cyclical or permanent a number of respondents echoed the sentiment that wed prefer to go back to the good old days when the economy was expanding even if that meant higher inflation wage settlements are now lower than a year ago for example central new york firms are projecting overall increases 1 12 percentage points below last years average of 9 percent
2415,2415,5-12-1982,New York,Financial Panel,this month we have comments from donald riefler morgan guaranty trust co francis schott equitable life assurance society and alfred wojnilower first boston corp their views of course are personal not institutionalriefler the fed should begin to modify its monetarist approach because of the poor correlation between ml as currently defined and nominal growth in the economy an acceptable range of real interest rates should be developed as a policy guide in addition to monetary targets federal reserve credibility would not suffer from this adjustmentschott institutional cash flow remains severely constrained by high interest rates improvement in federal budget prospects is essential although a modest decline in rates is widely anticipated anyway because of the recession and favorable inflation figuresfederal reserve policy continues to be appropriate despite much carping over the level of interest rates and over technical points of monetary policy responsible executives see no credible alternative to moderate restraint on the aggregateswojnilower the contraction in business activity appears to be near a bottom capital spending is being cut sharply but the decline in other final demand has probably endedfar too much is being made of the near term impact of the budget on interest rates the behavior of longer term interest rates over the next few months will be mainly governed by perceptions of the business outlook it is unlikely that these perceptions will be significantly influenced by the budget debate
2477,2477,6-23-1982,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,after holding up fairly well earlier in the recession the economy of the second district appeared to be weakening in may and early june the unemployment rate for the region remained below the nations but there were signs of deterioration in many sectors and localities indeed we were unable to find any concrete indications that an upturn had begun many of the gains scored by retailers in may could prove shortlived as early reports for june showed a decrease at some stores poor conditions generally prevailed in the residential construction sector nonresidential building was still brisk but the outlook was uncertain as softness in the office rental market persisted there was no letup in layoffs in the manufacturing sector and some producers noted sharp declines in their business it was therefore not surprising to find business leaders generally more pessimistic than last month with few looking for any recovery before yearend
2478,2478,6-23-1982,New York,Consumer Spending,retail activity increased in may as many department stores finished the month above plan the improvement could be shortlived however as some firms reported a weakening of sales in early june promotional activity was heavy throughout this period overall nondurable goods generally sold well despite a softening in apparel sales at a few stores sales of big ticket items like home furnishings stagnated while inventories did not pose serious problems stocks at some stores tended to the high side some retailers continued to expect the tax cut and social security increase to spur sales during the second half of the year
2479,2479,6-23-1982,New York,Construction and Real Estate Activity,residential construction remained depressed with sales and starts substantially below yearago levels as in our last report observers noted some positive signs in new york city sales of existing homes were still brisk in queens and sales of cooperative apartments in small buildings improved in brooklyn in suburban areas condominium construction increased modestly and buy downs stimulated some homebuyingthe outlook for nonresidential construction weakened many developers throughout the district postponed groundbreakings for new buildings but ongoing projects like battery park city are likely to sustain a high level of construction for the next few years the office rental market was soft again this month in both city and suburban areas enabling lessees to negotiate more favorable terms possibly foreshadowing further weakening of the midtown market two firmsone in advertising and one in publishingresisted large rent hikes by moving from prime space to less costly parts of manhattan nonetheless most respondents believed the office market was fundamentally sound demand for space was expected to grow rapidly as banking and the international sector in general expand further
2480,2480,6-23-1982,New York,Business Activity,business conditions varied widely across the region some previously strong areas such as syracuse reported a softening and those already hard hit such as buffalo deteriorated further although the rate of unemployment was essentially unchanged and still below the nations announcements of new workforce reductions continued in industries such as oil and steel firms shut down plants some permanently companies postponed or even canceled capital expenditure plans as capacity utilization fell and interest rates stayed high for many producers business distinctly worsened for example a ball bearing manufacturer reported that new orders fell to only 10 percent of the level of a few weeks previous and were running below cancellations similarly a furniture producer which had been prospering at the previously resilient luxury end of the market found that the demand for its goods had collapsed
2481,2481,6-23-1982,New York,Outlook,business leaders except for retailers turned more pessimistic and few looked for any upturn before the end of the year as economic conditions have weakened across the region hopes for an early turnaround have faded respondents from such previously strong areas as rochester and long island are voicing much more concern than before although their gloom does not approach that reported in buffalothe price slowdown continued but contacts expressed little confidence in its permanency once demand picks up prices are expected to rebound as firms restore profit margins a more encouraging sign on the price front was the apparent moderation in wage settlements with reports of increases in the 6 percent range not uncommon
2482,2482,6-23-1982,New York,Financial Panel,this month we have comments from david jones aubrey c lanston  co james oleary us trust co and robert stone irving trust co their views of course are personal not institutionaljones three factors are tending to prop up interest rates despite still pronounced recessionary tendencies first a commendably tight monetary policy second heavy federal government credit demands associated with an excessively loose fiscal policy third large desperation business borrowing as profitsstrained business competes with the federal government for funds to finance excessive inventory stocks interest payments wages and salaries and other necessities the upshot is likely to be continued high interest rates through most if not all the remainder of 1982 also there could be mounting business failures and major financial strains in the commercial paper and eurodollar markets which could operate to virtually cut off financing to less credit worthy borrowers paradoxically it may be that significant interest rate relief will not come until sustained economic recovery gets under way in 1983 only then will business those that survive the recession are likely to be lean cost efficient and highly productive be able to generate sufficient profits to be able to pay off shortterm debtoleary during the balance of the year the political and public pressures on the fed will intensify to an alarming level 1 the current increase in interest rates if it continues and is sustained may deepen the recession or at least postpone any significant recovery 2 the financial side of the economy is a minefield and crowding out is a serious danger 3 the fed does not have such room to maneuver before it begins to lose its credibility 4 the widely expected bulge in money supply in july will present a very difficult problem for the fed 5 the fear remains high the huge federal deficits and excessively easy credit will sooner or later lead to a new upward ratcheting of inflation 6 the longterm capital market is especially vulnerabledue in part to the changed position of the life insurance companies it has lost such of its stability and is much more susceptible to wide swings in psychologyunfortunately the fed has very little option and must adhere quite closely to its targets even if in the near term they contribute to a rise of shortterm rates prolongation of the recession and intense political pressure if instead the fed permits the monetary base to expand at the rate it has increased so far this year or even higher the result will be a sharp increase in interest rates in any event especially longterm rates adherence to the monetary targets will keep the heat on the administration and congress to hold down the federal deficit which is where the real policy problem lies not with federal reserve policystone the economy has reached bottom and activity has begun to turn up or will soon do so recovery is likely to be moderate however and should interest rates not decline it may abort in late 1982 or early 1983 the markets focus is currently on the possibility of another bulge in the aggregates in july and on the large treasury financing needs that loom aheadall against the background of the heightened state of uncertainty in the aftermath of drysdale with all of this it seems to me the appropriate course for the fed is to hold to its present nonborrowed reserves path and to let borrowings rise to meet the increase in reserve requirements associated with the july bulge in the aggregates should it occur but in view of the very fragile state of the market i believe the fed should temporarily speed up the provision of nonborrowed reserves if the rate increases that would accompany such a rise in borrowings should seem disorderly or excessive
2541,2541,8-18-1982,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the economy of the second district continued to languish in july and early august displaying more evidence of deterioration than recovery almost all sectors suffered from depressed business activity retail sales turned down at many stores residential construction showed no signs of pulling out of its persistent slump nonresidential construction however continued to be the healthiest segment of the regions economy in the manufacturing sector production schedules were cut through layoffs and shorter workweeks business leaders saw no reason to expect an upturn before the end of the year
2542,2542,8-18-1982,New York,Consumer Spending,retail activity was flat or down at almost all stores contacted few merchants achieved their july goals and some reported that business had distinctly worsened during the first week of august no respondent had yet observed any stimulus from the july tax cut or social security increase only a few nondurable products such as apparel and cosmetics demonstrated any strength and big ticket items continued to move slowly department stores maintained the heavy promotions of the past twelve months and one reduced markups to their lowest levels in recent years furthermore buying plans were tight although inventories generally were not considered high retailers had become more uncertain about the next few months but were hopeful that backtoschool shopping would bring a modest gain
2543,2543,8-18-1982,New York,Construction and Real Estate Activity,residential construction remained depressed the few bright signs noted during the past two months have not led to any significant improvement even the construction of highpriced condominiums and singlefamily homes which had been accounting for most of the activity appeared to have slowed many homebuilders experienced severe cash flow problems as suppliers pressed for faster paymentthe prospects for new nonresidential construction activity remained weaker than a few months ago but that sector was healthy relative to the rest of the economy while the recent softening in the office market persisted as reflected in a small rise in vacancy rates a considerable surplus of space that had been anticipated by some real estate brokers has not materialized observers nonetheless believed that few new buildings would be started in new york city until the economic recovery was well underway however ongoing projects were sustaining a high level of construction suburban areas showed some promise of renewed strength including the commencement of two large scale venturesan office park and a luxury hotel
2544,2544,8-18-1982,New York,Business Activity,business leaders throughout the district reported that economic activity had been flat at best and many observed evidence of additional deterioration capital goods producers cut production further with one firm considering the permanent closure of a plant in addition a large steel company just filed for bankruptcy auto production which picked up in june leveled off and high technology companies and producers of a variety of goods including firearms pianos and silverware were hurt by a lack of orders many of these firms shortened workweeks to four days or extended vacation shutdowns for a week or more workforce reductions both blue and white collar continued in a broad range of industries while scattered recalls were noted at a few plants they amounted to only a small proportion of the workers that had been laid off by those establishments a rising number of companies forecast real reductions in capital spending over the next year and inventories were being held at very tight levels
2545,2545,8-18-1982,New York,Outlook,business leaders felt that the economy would drift along at its current languid pace through the rest of the year even our contacts who had previously been the least pessimistic saw no indication that any pickup was imminent one respondent believed that an almost total lack of confidence by both businessmen and consumers would thwart any recovery another expressed the view that while the economy was on a low plateau a renewed deepening of the recession was more likely than an upturn
2546,2546,8-18-1982,New York,Financial Panel,this month we have comments from donald maude merrill lynch donald riefler morgan guaranty trust and francis schott equitable life assurance society their views of course are personal not institutionalmaude strains anticipated in the financial system have been alleviated to some degree by recent easing in federal reserve policy the easing has been accepted by the financial community as appropriate and desirable because of the perception that the recession still persists and the present turbulence in the financial sector but as signs of economic recovery become more evident and the wave of financial shocks recede the feds credibility will be scrutinized more critically the most recent easing moves combined with normal cyclical forces will probably lead to a renewed acceleration in money supply growthlooking ahead while interest rates will generally trend down there will be occasional pressures on rates and a risk of renewed recession over the first half of next yearriefler business conditions are poor and worldwide credit problems continue to mount the fed appears to be properly shifting its focus toward concern about the weak economy at the same time it would be reassuring to the capital markets for the fed to define more precisely its longer goal for the inflation rate which in my view should be zeroschott the widely forecast business recovery for the second half is not yet a reality erosive effects of weak cash flow are becoming more apparent in the industrial sector repercussions in the financial sector are also spreadingfederal reserve policy is mildly supportive of recovery more may have to be done
2611,2611,9-29-1982,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the rate of economic deterioration in the second district appeared to be slowing in august and september while it is still too soon to tell when the recovery will begin economic conditions do appear to be less bleak than they were in our last report retail sales have improved slightly construction activity has held steady with the residential sector still in the doldrums and nonresidential building strong in manufacturing layoffs have continued but generally were smaller than in previous months and some recalls occurred the reopening of a major steel facility offset other plant closings business leaders still expected no significant upturn before the end of the year
2612,2612,9-29-1982,New York,Consumer Spending,retail activity improved slightly from julys low level but has only now returned to yearago levels merchants had hoped for larger gains from backtoschool shopping and so were somewhat disappointed nonetheless sales were actually better in the eastern region than elsewhere around the country for at least some of the national retailers contacted apparel remained one of the stronger lines the slump in bigticket items like furniture and appliances showed no signs of ending stores intended to continue heavy promotions and aggressive pricing to move merchandise and were restraining their own buying until signs of an improvement appear inventories tended to the high side at a few stores but stocks were not expected to pose problems
2613,2613,9-29-1982,New York,Construction and Real Estate Activity,the construction picture was essentially unchanged from that reported over the last six months residential construction remained depressed in much of the district some builders expressed hope however that the usual autumn increase in demand for new homes to be delivered in the spring will manifest itself again this year while the recent decline in mortgage rates has not had a stimulative effect on new home building it has sparked some renewed interest in the purchase and renovation of existing homes home prices have generally held steady in recent monthsnonresidential real estate activity remained strong with the outlook still cloudy projects currently underway were viewed as sufficient to maintain construction employment at current levels for at least the next few months but softness in the office market was still evident in the new york city metropolitan area with vacancy rates up marginally and rents stable or down slightly consequently developers were reluctant to make long term commitments and were expected to continue to postpone some groundbreakings until the economy revives and the office market tightens new startups have not disappeared entirely however projects begun included office complexes in queens and on long island a shopping center in rochester and a large truck stop in buffalo
2614,2614,9-29-1982,New York,Business Activity,business leaders cited conflicting evidence on whether the economic slowdown in the district was bottoming out these mixed signs marked at least some improvement from the pervasive deterioration observed in august permanent shutdowns occurred at plants producing computer circuits and paper products as well as at the courierexpress a major newspaper in buffalo in addition layoffs continued in a wide range of industries including autos chemicals electronics office equipment and machine tools but the workforce reductions appeared to be generally small relative to those of the past couple of months moreover a few firms even in some of these same industries indicated that their businesses had finally stabilized and that some had even recalled workers another encouraging sign was the reopening of a major steel facility surprising employees who had been worried that the plant would be phased out altogether despite company assurances to the contrary
2615,2615,9-29-1982,New York,Outlook,business leaders remained skeptical of any significant upswing before yearend but overall the pessimism did not appear as deep as in august although our contacts reported that many businessmen across the district still forecast stagnation or even further deterioration into 1983 more now saw a glimmer of hope for early next year one survey of upstate companies plans for the fourth quarter found that the majority expected to maintain stable employment levels through the rest of the year and that those hoping to hire new workers slightly outnumbered those anticipating workforce cuts as for retailers many feared that the expected resurgence in consumer spending would be thwarted by concern over continued weakness in the economy
2616,2616,9-29-1982,New York,Financial Panel,this month we have comments from david jones aubrey c lanstonco robert stone irving trust and alfred wojnilower first boston corp their views of course are personal not institutionaljones the recessionary us economy has in all likelihood not yet hit bottom consumer psychology has deteriorated sharply businesses are continuing to try to cut back on spending on inventories and plant and equipment there is increasing emphasis on cost cutting measures including wholesale layoffs of whiteand bluecollar workers it may well be that interest rates particularly in the longer term corporate bond and mortgage markets must fall 200400 basis points further in order to set the stage for recovery further declines in interest rates particularly in the longer term areas are likely to be limited by the clash between heavy federal government borrowing and desperate businesses seeking to borrow long to repay shortterm debt the federal budget deficit for fiscal 1983 could climb to l60l70 billionthe income velocity of money is likely to fall far below its normal 3 percent growth trend both this year and next the feds current tentative ml target for 1983 leaves virtually no room for economic recovery given this prospective drop in velocity growth the fed might consider raising the upper limit of its tentative 1983 target for ml growth from 5 12 percent to perhaps 6 12 or 7 12 percentstone it seems to me that monetary policy is exactly on course it is appropriate that the fed persist in its efforts to limit the growth of the money supply but given the state of the economy the existence of serious financial problems and the continuing uncertainties surrounding the interpretation of the money supply it is also appropriate that the fed be pragmatic and flexible in its approach to limiting its growththe system has earned a good deal of credibility among market participants and i think there is little danger in losing it by being flexible in its approach to controlling the aggregateswojnilower reports from sources in industry continue grim as to both current business conditions and attitudes toward the future they do reflect however considerable disinflationary momentuminstitutional investors assume that the summers federal reserve actions mark a fundamental shift away from moneysupply rules toward an employmentoriented policy focused on interest rates such as is believed to have prevailed before october 1979 the stock market advance resembles the similar rather brief and spectacular bull markets that used to occur toward the end of recessions when the economy was seen as bottoming and the federal reserve as guaranteeing stable or falling shortterm rates until the fact of sustainable recovery had become statistically certain as a result the financial community is quite complacent that all will turn out well and tension in regard to potential default problems has subsided to an amazing degree
2674,2674,11-16-1982,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,reports from business leaders throughout the second district suggested that the regions economy has stopped declining though concrete signs of an upturn remained limited retail sales exhibited some sluggishness at the beginning of october but improved modestly in recent weeks although residential building was still at depressed levels builders have turned more optimistic nonresidential construction activity continued strong in manufacturing further layoffs occurred but at a greatly reduced rate even with some emerging signs of stabilization in the districts economy few of our business leaders foresaw an immediate upturn concern over the future course of interest rates was voiced by a wide range of our contacts
2675,2675,11-16-1982,New York,Consumer Spending,retail activity was sluggish at some stores at the beginning of october but improved modestly in more recent weeks for the month as a whole sales generally ran above the yearearlier pace nevertheless sales volume did not meet expectations of some merchants however national retailers again reported that sales tended to be better in the eastern region than elsewhere around the nation basic apparel and fashion goods were mentioned as strong items and one store noted a pickup in home furnishings inventories were generally in line for the holiday season but a few merchants reported some excess but not worrisome accumulation most retailers expected sales to hold up for the remainder of the year but only with continued heavy promotional activity and aggressive pricing
2676,2676,11-16-1982,New York,Construction and Real Estate Activity,for the first time in several months the residential construction market showed some signs of life while actual starts and sales of new homes remained slow in many areas of the district builders were generally more optimistic than they had been earlier real estate people noted a decided pickup in buyer inquiries which they attributed in part to the decline in mortgage rates the continued high level of interest rates on construction loans however dampened builder enthusiasm for initiating new projects home prices in the region remained steady with sellers still offering concessions such as buydownsnonresidential construction activity continued strong as a result of projects currently underway but announcements of major new projects were still scarce nevertheless respondents felt that an upturn was closer at hand even though the office market in the suburbs remained soft manhattan experienced a small but definite increase in leasing activity the first such increase in over six months moreover office rents have stopped slipping and the amount of vacant space did not increase
2677,2677,11-16-1982,New York,Business Activity,reports from business leaders throughout the district reinforced the view that the regions economy may have hit bottom although layoffs continued they occurred at a much reduced rate business activity for many defense contractors high technology manufacturers and finance and other service companies held strong unemployment rates in the region remained below the national rate rising less rapidly here than nationwide since the beginning of the year initial claims for unemployment insurance have basically held steady in contrast to the recent sharp upturn at the national level many of our respondents had previously expressed fears that the current recession would eventually trigger a repeat of the greaterthan national decline of the districts economy as occurred in the early seventies they now however feel more confident of the ability of the region to ride out the recession without a major collapse some areas of the region including new york city have even weathered the recession thus far without experiencing any yearoveryear drop in employment
2678,2678,11-16-1982,New York,Outlook,while the local economy appears to have stopped declining few of our respondents saw signs of an immediate upturn indeed some respondents feared that the national economy had not permanently bottomed out but had merely paused before resuming its downward slide uncertainty over the outlook grew from concerns that 1 the large deficits projected for all levels of government would bring back high interest rates 2 the recession would continue at the national level and begin to permeate the nonmanufacturing sector and 3 increases in the number of workers exhausting their unemployment benefits would dampen consumer spending skepticism as to the likelihood of any quick rebound was reinforced by a new york state department of labor official who found no strengthening in the average number of hours worked per week normally a precursor of any improvement in the economy nevertheless manufacturing inventories remained lean and companies appeared ready to step up production in response to any strengthening in orders
2679,2679,11-16-1982,New York,Financial Panel,this month we have comments from irving auerbach aubrey lanston and john olcay new york representative of londons w creenwell their views of course are personal not institutionalauerbach saw no prospects for a significant recovery unless interest rates fall much further even if that should happen soon the impetus to greater output would not take effect before the second quarter of next year so it is unlikely that 1983 will turn out to be strongolcay echoed similar thoughts an immediate cut in shortterm interest rates of about 2 percentage points is both warranted and necessary for any recovery to begin the risks in terms of inflationary expectations are minimal because the european economies are very weak and will not snap back until a us recovery is well underway by which time the federal reserve can again safely target ml so commodity markets will not tighten olcay put particular emphasis on the dollars strength which has severely eroded us export competitiveness it means that the domestic economy will have to grow by 12 percent just to keep overall gnp level
2743,2743,12-15-1982,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,in recent weeks the second district economy showed a few signs of improvement but the manufacturing sector remained depressed promotions sparked early holiday shopping in the district and resulted in a further strengthening of retail sales declining mortgage rates produced a modest rise in home sales and builders were cautiously optimistic about further growth recent developments in the nonresidential real estate market were mixed but some improvement did occur on balance in manufacturing however business leaders saw no pickup and reported increasing pessimism about the shortrun outlook
2744,2744,12-15-1982,New York,Consumer Spending,promotional efforts spurred early holiday shopping in the district and pushed yearoveryear gains in november above those of earlier months this strength was expected to continue through the holiday season the eastern region in general met or exceeded sales plans for those national retailers contacted while sales in much of the rest of the country continued to lag behind apparel cosmetics housewares and consumer electronics were all reported moving well seasonal increases in employment matched year ago levels for most stores and inventories were generally in line with planned sales retailers who had experienced a poor fall season expected business to be difficult again in 1983 but those with better sales in september and october looked forward to further gains in the new year
2745,2745,12-15-1982,New York,Construction and Real Estate Activity,the residential construction market showed additional signs of life during november though the rise in new home sales was modest moderately priced homes geared to firsttime homebuyers sold well the existing home market also experienced a pickup in sales activity declining mortgage rates were cited as a major factor in the sale of both new and existing homes as a result of the renewed interest on the part of actual and potential buyers builder optimism increased though some expressed concern that interest rates might rise again because of high credit demandthe nonresidential real estate market also improved but demand for space continued weak in many areas of the district activity and planning by office developers increased in midtown new york city even as the downtown market remained soft the pattern was also mixed in the suburbs leasing activity was up in new jersey and new construction occurred in westchester and long island while in connecticut the slow pace of previous months persisted industrial construction remained depressed throughout the district although some pickup was reported on long island
2746,2746,12-15-1982,New York,Business Activity,the manufacturing sector continued to be very weak except for the relatively healthy high technology and defense industries overall sales remained poor in industries ranging from metal fabricating to furniture many companies were finding it difficult to maintain steady production at a few concerns however orders were bolstered by a unique product line or the closure of a competitor cost cutting measures continued including layoffs and the spreading out of pay increases over longer periods of time shutdowns for christmas were expected to be longer than usual scattered recalls of workers occurred only in response to specific orders and therefore were viewed as temporary although the recent drop in interest rates eased liquidity problems somewhat several companies were thought to be bordering on insolvency and in need of buyers to bail them out the nonmanufacturing sector still has not suffered a severe downturn with some expansion continuing in the financial and service industries
2747,2747,12-15-1982,New York,Outlook,the outlook for retailing and construction brightened but our manufacturing contacts reported a deepening pessimism about the future when the rate of deterioration slowed in september these same contacts expressed a glimmer of hope that an upturn would begin within a couple of months since then the recovery has proven elusive and that glimmer has disappeared if demand should pick up however companies will be able to increase production quickly since inventories except for cars have been reduced to very low levels one of our respondents cited a lack of a coherent policy at the national level as the source of the pervasive gloom
2748,2748,12-15-1982,New York,Financial Panel,this month we have comments from donald maude merrill lynch donald riefler morgan guaranty trust and francis schott equitable life assurance society their views of course are personal not institutionalmaude a sustained economic recovery cannot get under way unless interest rates are brought down further however the fed is running out of leeway for bringing down these rates by pushing down the funds rate and the discount rate the credibility issue is growing and will become more real once the markets see signs of economic recovery to bring rates down in a credible fashion the fed should quantify publicly to the markets the magnitude of precautionary balance building that has bloated ml over the past year go back to shift adjusting other checkable deposits and come up with 1983 ml targets more realistic with trend changes in velocity and m2 targets that net out the bloating of interestcrediting to those components earning market rates of interestriefler there is a real danger that the specter of higher interest costs that may be incurred by banks in competing for deposits in new didc authorized accounts will slow banks willingness to reduce lending rates this in turn may delay the rebound in consumer spending that would be normal at this stage of the business cycleschott signs of revival in housing and automobiles and improved cash flow at thrifts and life insurance companies raise the question whether the fed has done enough to stimulate recovery an evaluation period may be appropriate nevertheless the number and extent of trouble situations domestically and internationally suggest that the indirect assistance of a further easing of credit conditions may well be advisable
2810,2810,2-2-1983,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,in recent weeks the second district economy showed a few more signs of improvement suggesting it has hit bottom and is beginning to turn up the retail sector experienced moderate gains in december and january sales substantially outpaced the yearago level lower mortgage rates stimulated home sales and builders were fairly optimistic about prospects for the spring some new nonresidential construction projects got underway even though the office market remained soft manufacturing continued to be generally depressed but business leaders found some indications that activity in that sector may be starting to pick up in sum the outlook has brightened somewhat
2811,2811,2-2-1983,New York,Consumer Spending,retailers finished december with strongerthanexpected sales and the gains continued into the new year heavy promotional efforts helped boost januarys volume substantially over the level of a year ago when inclement weather severely depressed activity apparel housewares and consumer electronics all moved well but bigticket items like furniture still attracted little attention inventories were generally at desired levels for most stores merchants were somewhat cautious about the outlook but some had increased their buying plans modestly in anticipation of gains in the spring
2812,2812,2-2-1983,New York,Construction and Real Estate Activity,additional signs of recovery appeared in the residential real estate market sales at several large condominium projects were spurred by lower mortgage rates as were the sales of existing homes citing a recent increase in the size of mortgages eligible for federal insurance developers announced plans to construct a large luxury rental building in manhattan the increased eligibility was also expected to make possible the construction of some longplanned residential complexes which had experienced financing difficulties district builders were fairly optimistic about the months aheadthe nonresidential real estate market also improved despite continuing softness in the office market ground was broken for two new office towers one in downtown new york city and one in westchester county developers announced plans for other office and mixed use projects although no starting dates have been set in addition construction was reported underway on a new resort development in one upstate new york community and plans for another are under discussion brokers did not report an increase in leasing activity but were hopeful that a pickup would materialize soon
2813,2813,2-2-1983,New York,Business Activity,although the manufacturing sector generally continued to operate at a very low level business leaders observed a number of signs that activity may be starting to pick up several of our contacts were encouraged by the recalls of automotive workers around the district tool and die producers were reported to be receiving a rising number of requests for bids in other industries such as instruments and ball bearings expanding production at some firms offset small workforce or pay cuts by others while the planned shutdown of a major steel facility in one area threatened to send the local unemployment rate up sharply plants in other parts of the district were being kept open by the transfer of ownership to local management groups or foreign companies the nonmanufacturing sector continued to hold up well in buffalo which has been particularly hardhit by the slump in manufacturing the financial and business services industries were doing quite well due to the areas growth as a regional banking center
2814,2814,2-2-1983,New York,Outlook,business leaders have begun to sense that the economy has finally hit bottom and are now hopeful that the recovery will get underway during the second quarter one source of the rising optimism was an increase in average weekly hours in most of the district our respondents generally believe that longer workweeks will be followed two or three months from now by increases in employment however one employment official who forecast an upswing also expressed concern that the recovery could be weak and shortlived as for capital spending none of our contacts saw an imminent rebound but one was encouraged by the record level of expenditures planned for 1983 by a major manufacturer in upstate new york
2815,2815,2-2-1983,New York,Financial Panel,this month we have comments from david jones aubrey lanston  co james oleary us trust and albert wojnilower first boston corp their views of course are personal not institutionaljones the economy appears to be poised for a strongerthanexpected bounceback in the early months of 1983 the recent surge in new orders provides an upward momentum that will likely be strengthened by rising consumer demand paced by spending on autos and housing this should in turn trigger the restocking of business inventories following an excessive inventory liquidation in the final quarter of 1982 at the same time however there is a possibility of nearterm upward pressure on interest rates particularly longer term rates this will stem partly from the fact that a strongerthanexpected recovery and the related stepup in inventory accumulation will lead to an unanticipated pickup in consumer and business credit demands more immediately the federal governments huge borrowing demands are likely to prove more difficult to manage particularly if the fed as suggested by recent remarks by chairman volcker moves to reassert monetary discipline the expected nearterm spurt in interest rates is likely to temporarily depress economic activity around midyear this could result in an uneven recovery pattern in 1983oleary the fear of an ultimate heating up of inflation remains strong in the fixedincome markets and it is a powerful force toward keeping real intermediate and longer term interest rates high this fear is nurtured by the huge federal deficit and the conviction that political pressures for economic expansion will cause the fed to keep credit excessively easy for too long a time the markets are nonetheless impressed that so far the fed is not following the feared patternwe appear to be in the early stages of a general business recovery but until there is clearer recognition that this is in fact the case it would be appropriate for the fed to continue cautiously to encourage lower interest rates and general business recovery by spring or certainly by early summer my guess is that the path of recovery will be sure enough that the authorities should begin to slow down the rate of increase of the monetary base and bank reserves this will provide assurance that the fed is not going to make the mistake of staying too long with an expansionary policy hopefully the move can be made gradually enough to avoid any runup of shortterm rates actually it should help to reduce longterm rates somewhat furtherwojnilower anecdotal contacts suggest even more strongly than do the fragmentary statistics that the economy has begun to expand with the exception of capital goods manufacturers attitudes among business executives have become distinctly more optimisticthis improvement in the economic climate coupled with official and private statements warning of the danger of reinflation has produced widespread market sentiment that interest rates will not decline much more if at all this makes interest rates prone to sporadic increases until it becomes clear that the economic recovery will be anemic or even better from the standpoint of the bond market participants nonexistent a collapse in oil prices would be a countervailing force that would significantly depress interest rates and in the shorter run also the economy recent contacts with individuals having exceptional highlevel familiarity with the situation suggest they share the general uncertaintyand the hope but also lack of conviction that an orderly and sustainable agreement on a lower market price in the 28 to 30 per barrel range might be reached
2875,2875,3-23-1983,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,additional signs of an upturn in the second district economy have appeared in recent weeks retail sales continued to exceed yearago levels in february and showed signs of further strengthening in early march lower mortgage rates stimulated a decided pickup in the residential real estate market and builders anticipate a moderate recovery this spring in the nonresidential sector the pattern was mixed leasing of office space grew in some areas but remained low in others in manufacturing rising orders spurred some firms to expand production although many industries have not seen any improvement so far business leaders have become more confident that the recovery is getting underway but are unsure how quickly it will gain momentum
2876,2876,3-23-1983,New York,Consumer Spending,during february retail activity continued to equal or surpass yearago levels heavy promotional activity continued and helped recoup the sales lost during a blizzard early in the month two of our contacts reported that sales improved further in early march consumer electronics and soft goods such as apparel moved well bigticket items remained weak overall however one respondent noted strength in home furniture and others observed increases in installment sales inventories were generally at planned levels and one department store had raised its desired stocks in anticipation of future sales growth other merchants also were hopeful that sales would strengthen further during the spring but some expressed concern that renewed consumer caution would limit any gains
2877,2877,3-23-1983,New York,Construction and Real Estate Activity,a decided pickup in the housing market occurred in recent weeks spurred by lower mortgage rates and a widespread concern that rates could rise again potential homebuyers were out looking in sizable numbers thus far however there has been only a modest increase in sales of new and existing homes residential construction activity appeared to be heading up also in manhattan plans for two large luxury apartment buildings were announced and several other sites have been cleared for construction in suburban areas builders and suppliers were reported to be very busy respondents anticipate further improvement through the spring but they noted that higher lumber costs could push home prices upthe nonresidential real estate sector continued to strengthen in much of the district a noticeable improvement occurred in the manhattan office market where several major leasing deals were signed in the midtown area while no major construction projects have been started in new york city since the last redbook construction on projects begun earlier remained strong and plans for another large office building were announced in suburban areas however activity was mixed the office markets in long island and connecticut were soft while inquiries for space rose significantly in new jersey
2878,2878,3-23-1983,New York,Business Activity,reports from business leaders around the district reinforced the view that manufacturing activity is beginning to turn up a variety of firms experienced increased orders and with inventories very low this renewed business led to sizable backlogs in some cases companies ranging from electronics producers to suppliers of auto components expanded production some plants lengthened their workweeks even to the point of adding overtime employment finally stabilized with recalls and new hiring at some plants sufficient to offset the workforce cuts still occurring at others nonetheless our contacts emphasized that many industries have not yet benefited from any pickup manufacturers of chemicals and capital equipment for example were noted still to be operating at very low levels and our respondents believed it would be some time before any improvement spread to these industries
2879,2879,3-23-1983,New York,Outlook,business leaders are becoming increasingly confident that a recovery is getting underway their main concern now is that the initial upswing may be too gradual to generate momentum for the longer run because manufacturers are reluctant to expand until they are sure the recovery is sustainable our contacts expect many firms to wait for a substantial accumulation of orders before committing themselves to rehiring workers rebuilding inventories or investing in new equipment
2880,2880,3-23-1983,New York,Financial Panel,this month we have comments from donald riefler morgan guaranty trust francis schott equitable life assurance society and robert stone irving trust their views of course are personal not institutionalriefler the recent firming of interest rates is a normal reaction to the improving economy however the resurrection of ml as a policy concern has raised the level of uncertainty in the market about the future direction and level of interest rates in view of the unusual relationship of ml to gnp in the last 12 to 18 months and the virtual impossibility of predicting with any certainty the impact of super now accounts on ml the deemphasis of this aggregate as a policy guide should be reiteratedschott there has been a major easing of cash flow at thrifts and life insurance companies funds for mediumterm bonds and mortgages are readily available lenders are still extremely reluctant to make longterm fixedrate commitments a clash between federal deficit financing needs and rising private credit demand is foreseen perhaps by early or mid1984 it is feared that either inflation will return or else interest rates escalate again an attack on the structural part of the federal deficit appears to be the only way to assure a steady supply of longterm funds for private capital formationstone whatever it is the fed has been doing it ought to continue to do it no reduction in the discount rate seems warranted since recovery is getting under way without it and since given the concern that some people have over the aggregates the reaction could turn out to be perverse my own view of the aggregates is that their significance is still not sufficiently clear to warrant taking any action to rein them in at a time when the recovery is still in its early stages should the pace of recovery accelerate and should aggregate growth remain high the fed may at some point have to take action that would lead to higher interest rates but it would be very premature to do that now hence i repeat the opening sentence whatever the fed has been doing it ought to continue to do it
2943,2943,5-18-1983,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the second district economy continued to show evidence of recovery in recent weeks major retailers reported that consumer spending remained strong and sales generally were above plans the residential real estate market picked up further but some slowdown in nonresidential construction was anticipated the upswing in manufacturing spread to more areas and firms in many industries were increasing hours and workforces on the financial side retail deposits at all classes of depository institutions have grown with the introduction of mmdas and super nows the consensus among business leaders is that the economy will continue to improve
2944,2944,5-18-1983,New York,Consumer Spending,retailers continued to enjoy yearoveryear sales gains over the past two months despite some temporary weakness in early april business at most department stores was running ahead of their plans one respondent did note however that promotional efforts lightyears ahead of last year were necessary to coax shoppers into buying soft goods and electronics continued to be sources of strength one merchant indicated that furniture began to pick up as well inventories remained at desired levels with one store keeping them aggressively heavy the outlook varied by respondent one discount chain was considering an upward revision in its sales goals while another retailer felt that the general optimism about the economy was unfounded
2945,2945,5-18-1983,New York,Construction and Real Estate Activity,the residential real estate market showed further improvement recently and respondents believe that an upswing is definitely underway both sales and starts showed healthy increases most of the growth was limited to high priced homes however some contacts believe a further drop in mortgage rates is needed before low and middlepriced homes will move while no one foresees a boom builders expressed a good deal of optimism about the next few months the outlook for nonresidential construction remained cloudy brokers reported that the absorption of office space improved in recent weeks a number of major leases were negotiated or signed in new york city and surrounding suburbs but observers see the pace of construction slowing with new space being completed and vacancy rates trending up rents have been flat and landlord concessions more prevalent consequently new projects are expected to be limited
2946,2946,5-18-1983,New York,Business Activity,the onset of recovery in the manufacturing sector was confirmed by recent reports from business leaders around the district areas hit particularly hard by the recession finally noted signs of an upturn and regions that had remained relatively healthy reported somewhat faster growth the upswing in autorelated industries has continued furniture orders finally rebounded leading one supplier to that industry to believe that recent signals could foreshadow one of his best years ever as backlogs developed and delivery times lengthened firms picked up production schedules shortened workweeks became much less common while some more layoffs occurred such diverse industries as autos aluminum and communications equipment were adding to their workforces
2947,2947,5-18-1983,New York,Outlook,business leaders are virtually unanimous in believing that the recovery has arrived although there is some disagreement concerning its strength our contacts have become more confident that the upswing will be sustained one respondent noted that while businessmen are still cautious they are expressing as much enthusiasm about the future as he can remember another believes prospects for economic growth look good for the next two or three years but one state labor official still fears that the recovery will be one of the slowest on record
2948,2948,5-18-1983,New York,Financial Developments,reflecting national trends home mortgage rates offered at banks and thrifts in the second district have fallen by as much as 5 percentage points since last summer while some of the institutions contacted offer only variable rates on home mortgages most of those that offer both fixed and variable rates report that a very high proportion of new mortgages about 75 percent have fixed rates in part this reflects a narrowing of the spreads between the fixed and variable rates in addition most said that at least 20 of the mortgages now being made represent refinancings wherein households prefer to substitute one fixed rate instrument for anothermany of the banks and thrifts contacted said that they are selling the bulk of their new mortgages in the secondary market one institution specified that it is now mainly selling the fixed rate mortgages and using mmdas to fund the variable rate mortgages all in all the institutions appear aware of the potential for mismatching assets and liabilities resulting from the inflow of mmdassince the introduction of mmdas and super nows all classes of depository institutions in the second district have gained retail deposits the commercial banks however were clearly the biggest gainers in both dollar volume and market share according to our estimates between midnovember 1982 and midmarch 1983 second district commercial banks raised their share of the retail deposit market by as much as 5 full percentage points from 30 percent to 35 percent by comparison in the rest of the nation it appears that the commercial bank gains in retail market share were considerably smaller some new york banks have expressed concern about the need to replace funding sources as the market for moneycenter cds shrinks along with money market mutual funds perhaps because of this concern competition for mmda money has been particularly keen in new york city where the rates offered on these accounts have been consistently higher than the national average
2949,2949,5-18-1983,New York,Financial Panel,this month we have comments from david jones aubrey lanston  co donald maude merrill lynch and albert wojnilower first boston corp their views of course are personal not institutionaljones the critical mass for economic recovery is now in place and the question now is whether the recovery will be moderate or brisk the seeds of recovery were planted by a sharp decline in interest rates in the second half of last year more recently there has been a pickup in demand in such interestsensitive sectors as housing autos and other durable goods in the improved economic climate businesses cut their rate of inventory liquidation roughly in half in the first quarter of this year and some actual restocking may begin in the second quarter thus further strengthening new orders production employment and income the recovery is however likely to remain moderate and uneven through 1984 serving to limit economic gains are likely to be abnormally high real rates reflecting the clash between recoveryrelated increases in consumer and business credit demands and excessive federal borrowing demands arising from mounting structural deficits accordingly the recovery is likely to stall from time to time as business spending on new plant and equipment remains depressed both because of high real rates and a huge margin of unused capacity and as us exports continue weak because of a strong dollar all in all real gnp might show gains of 50 percent in the second quarter 20 percent in the third quarter and 40 percent in the fourth quarter in 1984 the pattern might be 60 percent in the first quarter 70 percent in the second quarter 30 percent in the third quarter and 40 percent in the fourth quartermaude while progressing at an uneven pace as is almost invariably the case in the early recovery phase the present economic recovery should remain intact going into 1984 in an environment of restrained inflation and inflationary expectations presently we envision a second half 1983 gain in real gnp of 5 percent and an annual rate of increase of 57 percent in the consumer price index under such conditions private credit demands throughout the remainder of the year should remain sufficiently restrained to allow the treasury to raise a projected 110120 billion net new cash over the final two quarters of 1983 without much disruption to the financial markets on balance however even a controlled slow growth recovery runs the risk of being aborted as early as the first half of 1984 as rising private credit demands begin to clash with fiscal 1984 treasury financing requirements exceeding 200 billionpotentially leading to a meaningful upward spike in interest rates indeed even at present real interest rate levels the sustainability of the recovery remains tenuous however monetary policy is once again perceived by the financial markets as credible and latitude for further accommodation in an interest rate sense presently existswojnilower domestic business contacts suggest that the economic recovery is broadening somewhat and that confidence for the longer pull has increased materially at the same time the nearly explosive attitude displayed previously by executives in some segments of the department store steel and building materials industries has sobered as what in their perception were initially extraordinary sales gains have slowed considerably in the security markets large amounts of new issues of all types continue to be placed demand by foreign investors is enormous but a torrential reversal well might ensue if policies to weaken the dollar were officially adopted during a visit to europe last week i gathered the impression that the reported business pickup on the continent may be more an improvement in sentiment than in performance in france of course a sharp setback in business is anticipated in the united kingdom mrs thatchers reelection is taken virtually for granted and people are quite sure that business is rebounding
3012,3012,7-1-1983,New York,Introduction,the economic recovery continued at a steady pace in most of the second district through may and june but some industries and regions are not yet experiencing renewed economic growth the most dynamic sectors of the districts economy were homebuilding high technology industries some automotive suppliers and the financial and service industries the regions in which these industries dominatenew york city northern new jersey long island syracuse and albanyare performing well it also appears that the patrons of upscale retail establishments are spending much more than they were last yearin the regions that specialize in the manufacturing of steel and producers durables recovery has yet to begin and some observers of these areas are not even sure that the recession has bottomed out unemployment rates remain above 13 percent in buffalo and elmira for example in general the unemployed manufacturing workforce has not been called back in large numbers other weak spots include the agricultural sector and possibly the office construction industry as wellsome local firms are beginning to increase their borrowing from banks as economic activity strengthens but overall the pickup remains spotty new inflows of deposits associated with the mmdas have encouraged banks to be more aggressive in expanding loans to businesses and demand has strengthened for construction loans inventory financing and loans to computerrelated companies nevertheless in the industries and regions where the economic recovery has not been felt loan demand remains very sluggishon the price side only a little immediate upward pressure has been felt on most prices however some shortages of construction materials have developed and the increasing cost of medical insurance is raising widespread concern
3013,3013,7-1-1983,New York,Manufacturing,with the exception of the heavy industrial plants of the buffalo area most district manufacturers are reporting increases in orders and shipments the high technology sectors on long island and in the albany area have done especially well and the automotive suppliers near jamestown and syracuse are beginning to resupply the big three however growth in output has not yet translated into decreases in unemployment in most places unemployment in all of the districts major labor market areas except poughkeepsie remains higher than it was a year ago employers for the most part have been increasing the length of workweeks instead of recalling laid off workers
3014,3014,7-1-1983,New York,Retailing,the districts major retail chains continue to compete intensely for market share sales to middle income households especially have been described as a competitive blood bath the stores serving high income clientele have enjoyed the largest sales increases over last year while the lower priced chains have had substantially smaller gains
3015,3015,7-1-1983,New York,The Financial Sector,the drop in interest rates since last summer continues to improve the earnings outlook for thrift institutions in the second district on average quarterly losses at new york state mutual savings banks were considerably smaller in qi 1983 than during 1982 similarly by the end of 1982 over half of the savings and loan associations in new york and new jersey had turned profitable and more recently this proportion has risen furtherdeposit inflows at thrifts have increased as a result of the mmdas particularly outside of new york city new savings inflows to new york and new jersey sls have picked up in 1983 and recent inflows appear to have been the strongest in several years at new york mutual savings banks the rise in net deposits since last year has generally been more modest in part this reflects the high degree of competition for funds in the new york city market moreover some of the savings banks are not aggressively expanding their liabilities as a result of concern over their capital positions
3016,3016,7-1-1983,New York,Public Finance,the continuing strong performance of the new york city economyled by the finance and service industrieshas improved local fiscal circumstances markedly in january the citys financial analysts were predicting a large deficit and local leaders were planning large tax increases and the layoffs of some 4000 school district employees since then revenue collections have exceeded expectations in every month the latest projections envision a substantial budget surplus and plans are being considered for service improvementsthe stronger than expected performance of the citys economy and the improved condition of its treasury helped pave the way for new yorks reentry into municipal bond markets the citys first competitive bond issue since the fiscal crisis of the mid 1970s recently received a respectable welcome in the market although still at a relatively low credit rating
3017,3017,7-1-1983,New York,Agriculture,the wet weather this spring is not expected to reduce crop production in new york state however net farm income was flat in new york last year and is expected to remain so this year corn acreage has been reduced through the payment in kind program but pik does not apply to new yorks large dairy and fruit industries agriculture should therefore remain a weak sector of the district economy
3018,3018,7-1-1983,New York,Construction and Real Estate,housing sales and construction continued to increase in may though they were curtailed somewhat by the bad weather in recent weeks some signs have emerged that buying activity has spread to smaller less expensive homes in contrast to the first quarter when sales were largely confined to the more expensive end of the marketin the northern and eastern suburbs of new york city and in syracuse commercial real estate and construction markets remained quite active in other areas the amount of new space about to come on market suggests that construction starts will be sluggish through 1983 however most observers of commercial real estate in the district remain optimistic regarding the prospects for filling existing office space and expect new construction projects to follow before too long
3019,3019,7-1-1983,New York,Wages and Prices,with two exceptions major wage or price increases are not likely this year most wage settlements are calling for increases below six percent and most industries apparently consider competition too strong to venture significant price increasesone exception is building materials contractors are experiencing shortages of lumber and of skilled labor however increases in the prices of these inputs are typical during the early phase of an expansion of housing constructionthe second exception to the general picture of price stability is causing more concern the costs of health care and therefore of employee medical insurance continue to increase quite rapidly employers are beginning to experiment with and even implement changes in their medical insurance programs aimed at reducing these costs some savings have been realized but changes are meeting employee resistance
3088,3088,8-10-1983,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,in recent weeks the economic recovery grew stronger in much of the second district retail activity was very brisk in june and though the july pace was a little slower sales remained well above yearago levels at most stores additional signs of strength were evident in the housing and nonresidential real estate markets business activity continued to pick up in the manufacturing sector where producers of many different goods reported rising orders however manufacturers remain generally cautious about production increases and new hirings and demand for new business loans is still slack agricultural conditions are mixed fruit and field crops look good but the dry weather in july has hurt the vegetable crop
3089,3089,8-10-1983,New York,Consumer Spending,retailers described their june sales as outstanding and extraordinary most of our respondents representing a broad range of income markets also posted doubledigit gains over yearago levels in july one suburban discount chain reported that july sales were gangbusters up 25 to 30 percent others felt the july pace was not quite as good as the prior month but attributed the slight falloff to special factors such as hot weather or store remodeling they saw nothing to indicate a slowdown in the recovery the only report of sluggish demand came from an upstate new york chain of department stores lingering weakness in some local economies held gains there to only two percent above last year respondents indicated they were increasing their inventories in anticipation of greater activity two were letting their stocks rise faster than sales the competitive environment which had been quite fierce earlier this year appeared to be easing but the level of promotional activity generally remained high
3090,3090,8-10-1983,New York,Construction and Real Estate,residential construction activity remained at a high level during recent weeks many homebuilders have enough contracts to carry them through the rest of the year in fact the industry has been so busy in some areas that a significant shortage of skilled labor has materialized while the current levels of sales and construction activity are quite high builders are wary about the recent upturn in interest rates they fear higher mortgage rates could cut the demand for homes next year however future construction activity is likely to be stimulated by recent new york state legislation which will provide millions of dollars in low interest loans for the private construction of multifamily rental housingthe nonresidential real estate sector appeared to be strengthening further especially in suburban areas the rate at which available space is being leased has picked up significantly and ground was broken for a number of office buildings in new jersey and connecticut work on ongoing projects continued strong although announcements of new construction projects in new york city are expected to remain scarce for awhile several promising properties were purchased by developers in the downtown manhattan areaindicating a definite firming in market conditions
3091,3091,8-10-1983,New York,Manufacturing,business activity continued to pick up in the manufacturing sector manufacturers of diverse producer and consumer goods such as chemicals electrical equipment home weather stripping and toys reported that orders were rising auto parts suppliers noted that their upswing has been maintained and several defense companies were awarded sizable contracts businessmen generally are now convinced that the economy will continue to expand but they remain cautious nonetheless production increases still are being scheduled primarily to meet incoming orders rather than to rebuild inventories moreover while recalls have significantly reduced the number of employees on layoff few firms are expected to add new workers soon one respondent thought it would take several more months of improvement before firms would make longrange commitments to capital projects or substantial new hiring
3092,3092,8-10-1983,New York,Agriculture,conditions in the agricultural sector vary by product the new york fruit crop looks favorable and growers are anticipating attractive prices as well field crops have recovered from earlier bad weather although first cuttings are occurring a few weeks later than usual in contrast vegetable yields have been threatened by an unusually dry july dairy farmers are concerned about rising production costs grain prices have begun moving upward in response to pikrelated crop reductions and a general buildup in herd size is expected to exert further pressure on feed costs
3093,3093,8-10-1983,New York,Financial Developments,the strong economic recovery nationwide has not been reflected in the demand for business loans at second district regional banks in july these banks reported only a slight increase in business loans outstanding mostly stemming from takedowns under existing lines of credit and almost no increase in new applications for business loans in contrast in the consumer sector strong increases in the demand for creditfor auto purchases personal loans and charge card purchasesseem to reflect rising consumer confidence and ample loanable funds at banks the demand for mortgage credit appears to have backed off a bit because of recent increases in longterm rates
3161,3161,9-20-1983,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,an uneven economic recovery in the second district continued in august consumer spending appeared to be slowing from the extraordinary pace of early summer though gains over 1982 were still substantial at some stores residential construction was strong homebuilders are booked up for the next few months nonresidential construction improved further with some industrial and commercial projects getting underway most manufacturers saw a pickup in activity but heavy goods producers saw little improvement in the agricultural sector a summer drought damaged corn and hay crops but harvests of fruit are expected to be high on the financial side business lending was flat and automobile loans picked up
3162,3162,9-20-1983,New York,Consumer Spending,retail activity continued to slacken in recent weeks although some department stores still achieved healthy doubledigit gains over a year ago the volume of sales in august was generally lower than in may and june the pace appeared to be slowing further in early september one middleincome chain experienced four straight weeks of declining sales and reported that by early september volume was less than last year some merchants felt that hot weather was a key factor in depressing sales especially those of autumn apparel retailers are hopeful that business will pick up when the weather cools
3163,3163,9-20-1983,New York,Construction and Real Estate,residential construction continued at a rapid pace builders of custom homes are fully booked through the next few months and speculative projects mostly condominiums are increasing this activity has caused shortages of supplies and labor to become more severe despite the current activity builders are anxious about next spring traffic has fallen recently while such a slowdown is normal around labor day there is concern that higher interest rates may be discouraging buyers if the normal pickup in october fails to materialize construction will fall off during the first half of next yearthe nonresidential real estate market continued to improve throughout most of the district leasing activity increased further in downtown new york new jersey and on long island although new starts of office construction remained rare our contacts reported that some buildings are being planned furthermore several industrial and commercial development projects are planned or underway in new york citys outer boroughs with a good deal of public sector participation and plans for major retail mall projects have been reported in manhattan long island and the albany area
3164,3164,9-20-1983,New York,Business Activity,manufacturing activity continued to pick up throughout the district but the extent of the upturn was uneven high technology companies including producers of computers semiconductors defense electronics and medical equipment experienced the sharpest gains and several of these firms announced expansion plans in other industries such as plastics and instruments sales gains were modest in heavy goods industries however no significant pickup has been reported while steel production rose marginally in western new york almost half of the industrys capacity remained idle and although capital goods producers were finding more projects on which to bid they had still not observed any significant rise in solid ordersas for employment a state labor official felt the job market was just beginning to turn up with the strongest relative improvement in the services and construction sectors by contrast some major insurance companies reported efforts to cut costs by reducing employment levels or by moving jobs outside manhattan unemployment districtwide remained below the national level but in some areas reentrants to the labor force were expected to keep rates high even as employment levels rise in new york city in particular the rapid increase in the labor force pushed unemployment to 106 percent in july and august
3165,3165,9-20-1983,New York,Agriculture,in the agricultural sector bad weather has damaged some crops but has had little effect on others the drought during july and august depressed yields per acre for corn and hay in contrast wheat was harvested early during the dry spell and yields were high the fruitgrowing regions had adequate rain and good crops are expected the apple harvest may be one of the largest on record high yields and low demand for new york wines have combined to depress the price of grapes however in the dairy industry high production has limited price increases and profits are expected to be squeezed as feed costs climb
3166,3166,9-20-1983,New York,Financial Developments,banks surveyed in early september reported that business lending showed little improvement any increase at individual institutions moreover was attributed to their marketing efforts rather than any improvement in overall loan demand most institutions in the region have taken an unaggressive approach to mortgage lending as rates have backed up and demand for loans has dropped off  in contrast the volume of both direct auto loans and dealer paper has picked up during the summer as auto sales have surged further the competitive position of banks is expected to improve as many interest rate promotions of auto finance companies end with the deregulation of most types of consumer time deposits beginning october 1 some institutions have begun extensive promotional campaigns in some cases offering retail repurchase agreements at high rates until october 1 when the funds will be converted into longer term time deposits
3234,3234,11-2-1983,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,economic activity in the second district continued to show improvement in recent weeks in comparison to the mixed picture we reported in late summer almost all second district economic indicators now appear to be headed upward department store sales picked up sharply in late september when a long period of unusually hot weather ended homebuilders have been quite busy and expect to remain so over the next few months the brisk pace of office leasing activity was maintained in new jersey and southern connecticut and has begun to spread into midtown manhattan as well the new jersey and connecticut legislatures have authorized increased expenditures on upgrading roads and bridges and new yorkers will vote on an infrastructure bond referendum in november the regions manufacturing activity expanded further but employment gains are still slow on the financial side business loan demand is beginning to pick up
3235,3235,11-2-1983,New York,Consumer Spending,the pace of retail spending in the second district has shown some improvement in recent weeks most respondents stated that the unusually hot weather in the first half of september depressed sales however after the temperature cooled widespread sharp gains were registered towards the end of the month a new york state chain for example noted overall september sales showed no improvement over the yearago level but activity in the final week of the month was seven percent above the corresponding 1982 figure another large retailer with a lowerthanplanned sales increase of five percent in september had a 15 percent gain in early october albeit with the help of some special promotions only one merchant reported weakening of sales in october citing the fact that the weather had not yet been cold enough to spur sales of warm clothing inventories were reported at satisfactory levels with only one retailer mentioning that they may be a little high sales at most stores remained at or above planned levels and the outlook for the fourth quarter generally is optimistic
3236,3236,11-2-1983,New York,Construction and Real Estate,residential construction activity remained strong throughout the district and builders have contracts which should keep them busy into the spring after that however the outlook is uncertain october is typically the time when prospective buyers begin looking for homes to be completed the next summer however while weekend traffic has picked up in new jersey demand thus far has been sluggish in much of new york higher mortgage rates were cited as a factor in addition some new york builders have postponed seeking contracts for summer delivery because of uncertainty about rising costs of materials and labor availabilitythe brisk pace of nonresidential real estate activity was maintained in recent weeks a high volume of leasing transactions continued in new jersey southern connecticut and various new york city suburban areas our contacts also noted a definite upswing in midtown manhattan as earlier negotiations for space are now culminating in actual commitmentsstate governments in the district plan a substantial upgrading of roads bridges and public transportation the legislatures of new jersey and connecticut have already increased bonding authority for improving transportation infrastructure new yorkers will vote in early november on a referendum for a 125 billion debt issue but even if that fails the pace of infrastructure renovation will increase in new york
3237,3237,11-2-1983,New York,Business Activity,business activity continued to expand in the manufacturing sector but at a generally moderate pace the upturn at automotive manufacturers and suppliers has been maintained but a producer of truck engines reported some temporary difficulty obtaining parts manufacturers of products such as electrical equipment and optical supplies have already begun a modest hiring of new employees other firms anticipate additional hiring when plant expansions which are currently underway are completed several high technology firms announced plans to expand and ground was recently broken on long island for a hightech industrial park many manufacturers continued a cautious inventory policy but for the first time in several months some firms expressed a willingness to begin inventory accumulation a more positive attitude about the continuation of the recovery was noted throughout most of the districtunemployment rates have recently fallen throughout the region but remain above yearago levels in some areas
3238,3238,11-2-1983,New York,Financial Developments,second district banks report a pickup in business lending in recent weeks some banks have become more aggressive in seeking new customers in addition demand has also been increasing as business financing needs begin to rise and interest rates offered on loans remain relatively flat business lending appears to be comparatively stronger outside the immediate new york city areamortgage lending seems to be flat but bank offering particularly competitive rates have been able to raise their market sharesthe deregulation of most consumer time deposits on october 1 resulted in many banks and thrifts institutions in new york city offering very attractive rates particularly on sixmonth certificates where rates were offered as high as 11 percent
3304,3304,12-6-1983,New York,Introduction,the pace of the recovery seems to be picking up a bit in the second district consumer spending is strong and retailers say that early indications point to a good holiday season manufacturing activity continues to expand at a moderate pace and observers of the upstate economy feel that the worst is finally over homebuilders are working at capacity and have become more optimistic about the outlook for next year office construction remains strong and leasing activity continues to grow in much of the district spending on infrastructure should be substantial in the months ahead since voters in new york and new jersey recently approved the issuance of l4 billion of transportation bonds on the financial side consumer borrowing strengthened somewhat in part due to stronger demand for auto loans
3305,3305,12-6-1983,New York,Consumer Spending,retail spending improved further in late october and november and the gains at district stores were broadly based several chains running the gamut from highincome to discount stores reported doubledigit increases over the comparable period a year ago the sharpest improvement occurred in an upstate chain which had been doing poorly most of the year sales at most stores were reported at planned levels or even higher with only one respondent noting a weaker than expected increase furniture and various kinds of apparel were mentioned as products in strong demand inventories were generally reported at satisfactory levels increasing only in line with sales however one chain mentioned problems in keeping up with demand for a few hot items most district retailers anticipate that this christmas season will be stronger than last years consumers have begun their buying earlier and sales for the first few days of the season have been quite encouraging
3306,3306,12-6-1983,New York,Construction and Real Estate,residential construction remains strong throughout the district aided by unseasonably mild weather however shortages of skilled labor and some materials continue to delay building activity in new york city suburban areas homebuilders remain booked through the spring and the outlook for next summer is generally improving customer traffic has been heavy and increasingly composed of serious buyers nevertheless a few builders fearing higher interest rates are concerned about possible reduced demand in the months aheadthe nonresidential real estate market remains active and has shown further improvement new leasing commitments are being made around the district at a rapid pace manhattan is particularly strong and as a result confidence is now growing in the ability of this market to absorb the new office space currently under construction however some concern has developed about possible overbuilding in parts of new jersey and connecticutthe state governments of new york and new jersey have received voter approval for increased borrowing for infrastructure renewal in novembers elections a total for the two states of 14 billion was authorized for extensive upgrading of roads bridges and public transportation
3307,3307,12-6-1983,New York,Business Activity,a further moderate expansion in district manufacturing activity occurred during recent weeks the automotive sector continues strong with some firms which had been using their existing workforce overtime now reporting sufficient demand to allow new hiring capital goods manufacturers have also begun to show some improvement several have now returned to full workweeks after months of operating on shortened schedules in addition spending for plant and equipment is underway or planned by various industries such as computers medical equipment and health and beauty productssome upstate areas that were particularly hard hit by the recession now report a much more optimistic outlook and a feeling that the worst is over in buffalo for example the latest survey of purchasing managers showed the highest percentages reporting increased new orders and employment in several yearsunemployment rates in most district labor market areas are generally below their levels of a year ago however while employment has been increasing in recent months it still remains well below yearago levels in several areas
3308,3308,12-6-1983,New York,Financial Developments,consumer borrowing has strengthened somewhat in the region discussions with bank representatives in the second district indicate that most institutions are becoming more aggressive in the consumer loan market by reducing rates and increasing advertising the demand for auto loans in particular has been up sharply because of bank promotions termination of auto finance company incentives and introduction of new car models some banks also report increased issuance of bank credit cards and higher outstanding balances on these accountsin line with the national trend district banks have been stressing adjustable rate mortgages arms about half of new mortgages are arms and several institutions report that all their new mortgages are adjustable rate however portfolios still remain heavily weighted with fixed rate instruments the spread between interest rates on fixed rate and adjustable rate contracts is currently at about 2 percentage points this spread has narrowed only slightly in recent months
3373,3373,1-20-1984,New York,Introduction,the improvement in the second districts economy is continuing at a moderate pace the christmas season was a strong one for area retailers with sale gains over the lackluster yearearlier period in the 10 to 20 percent range manufacturing activity continues to expand led by strength in the automotive sector purchasing managers note a pickup in orders and an increased willingness to accumulate inventories the nonresidential real estate market remains strong with a quickening pace of leasing activity and the announcement of new building projects residential construction is at a seasonal low but the outlook for the spring is favorable on the financial side banks report a modest increase in business borrowing and strong demand for consumer credit
3374,3374,1-20-1984,New York,Consumer Spending,second district retailers reported brisk sales during the christmas season with overtheyear increases in december generally in the 10 to 20 percent range business exceeded expectations at most stores and only one upstate new york chain recorded a decembertodecember gain of less than 10 percent spending was generally heavy from the thanksgiving weekend to christmas and a wide range of products was reported in demand this contrasted with 1982 when sales were weak until late in the season and stores engaged in heavy promotional activity prior to christmas sales continued strong in the final week of 1983 but in early january reports were more mixed with growth over 1983 ranging from flat to 20 percent some stores report low levels of inventories and a desire to rep1enish stocks others plan to increase inventories only in line with sales most retailers expect demand to remain strong compared to the levels of a year ago but with much smaller overtheyear gains than in december
3375,3375,1-20-1984,New York,Business Activity,business activity in the second district continued expanding at a moderate pace in recent weeks while the automotive industry remains the major source of strength throughout much of the district other manufacturing industries reporting improvement were electrical and nonelectrical machinery fabricated metals chemicals and food products new orders are continuing to improve and purchasing managers in some upstate areas noted an increased willingness to accumulate inventoriesseveral companies have recently announced plans to open new facilities in the district these include a large printing plant in saratoga springs a computer operations center on long island end a factory for producing computer components in the poughkeepsie area in addition a number of companies will soon begin expansion and renovation of their existing operations the largest of these projects is a 67 million 2year modernization and expansion of a paper mill in upstate new york in most cases these new installations and expansions are expected to generate increased employmentunemployment has declined in the second district in line with the national trend the december unemployment rate in new york state was 74 percent an overtheyear improvement of l7 percentage points while new jerseys 68 percent rate was 24 percentage points below its december 1982 level
3376,3376,1-20-1984,New York,Construction and Real Estate,residential construction activity is at a seasonal low now that cold weather has moved into the district traffic and sales have also slowed and are not expected to pick up before the end of january over the next few months though the outlook remains bright homebuilders are fully booked through the spring nonetheless many question the sustainability of last years construction pace they believe that most of the pentup demand has already been satisfied and that lower mortgage rates and stable housing prices will be needed to generate much additional interest from potential homebuyers builders seem skeptical that prices will stabilize in the nearterm because of ongoing labor and materials shortages and the likelihood of continuing large federal deficits makes them doubt that mortgage rates will decline muchthe nonresidential real estate market continues to exhibit signs of strength leasing of office space has progressed at a brisk pace and generally without significant rent reductions or other landlord concessions although nonresidential starts have been scarce several new plans for future projects have recently been announced some of these represent expansions into what are generally considered secondary locations such as the west side and the area north of the world trade center in manhattan and north of the route 287 corridor in westchester county
3377,3377,1-20-1984,New York,Financial Developments,banks in the second district have reported a modest increase in business borrowing during the last month inventories receivables machine tool purchases construction and capital expansion were cited as uses for the increased loans although no one purpose was singled out as being particularly significant one respondent noted an expansion of loan demand at middlesize corporations but no increase for the largest corporationsconsumer borrowing remained strong in recent weeks in particular auto loan demand was cited as being robust some banks reported that strong consumer credit demand has continued into early january instead of the usual afterchristmas slowing

3444,3444,3-13-1984,New York,Consumer Spending,district department store sales slowed early in the year from their brisk holiday season pace hut regained momentum in february sales growth over yearago levels generally ranged from flat to 10 percent in january and from 10 percent to 27 percent in february in part the large increases in february were due to a major snowstorm that hampered sales a year earlier even among individual retailers the januaryfebruary period was marked by extremes one major retailer for example reported january sales were little better than the yearago level but februarys were 20 percent greater than in 1983in contrast to the past few months when inventories were generally satisfactory two major retailers noted unexpectedly high inventory accumulation in january one intends to increase promotions and markdown in order to reduce the overstock but the other anticipates sufficient sales volume in coming months to resolve the problem in general our contacts are optimistic about sales in the near future
3445,3445,3-13-1984,New York,Business Activity,manufacturing activity in the district continued to improve at the same moderate pace of the last few months the automotive industry remained strong and two transportationrelated companies recently announced sizable investment plans for the production of new engine and tire lines makers of defense products and capital good manufacturers also registered gains in addition some upstate areas report an upturn in specialty steel orders activity in basic steel remains sluggish however and plans to close a foundry were announcedfirms in a variety of industries announced plans for new buildings or expansion and modernization of existing plants these projects include a computer products facility an accounting services firm a glass manufacturer and a sheet metal plant moreover surveys of purchasing agents and manufacturers in several upstate areas indicate a widespread optimism concerning the outlook for area businesses in 1984 and plans for additional capital expendituresemployment levels are now higher than a year ago throughout the district although many areas have not regained their prerecession peaks unemployment rates generally are well below yearearlier levels
3446,3446,3-13-1984,New York,Construction and Real Estate,demand for new housing has been surprisingly strong recently and some builders now anticipate even higher levels of activity than last year demand by interestsensitive middle income buyers is particularly apparent in the southern part of the district stable interest rates and greater acceptance of adjustable rate mortgages are two factors cited for the attraction of middle income buyers over the longer term the level of residential construction is likely to be boosted in the next few years by a series of court decisions mandating new low and middle income housing in parts of new jerseythe nonresidential market has been mixed in the district the demand for space in midtown manhattan improved further in recent weeks and was characterized by one real estate broker as fantastic downtown manhattan is also active continuing the pace of recent months many firms seeking large blocks of space are said to be negotiating leases however the market softened somewhat in suburban areas of westchester and fairfield counties and western nassau county where large amounts of new office space have recently come on line
3447,3447,3-13-1984,New York,Financial Developments,sizable deposit inflows during 1983 have contributed to banks willingness to accommodate strong consumer loan demand while profit margins on consumer loans have fallen somewhat because of the continued high cost of funds banks are still competing aggressively for larger shares of the market noting that consumer demand for funds usually picks up in the spring some banks plan special promotions in the near future to try to gain additional market share
3512,3512,5-8-1984,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,introduction the slowdown in the national economic recovery suggested by the leading indicators and unemployment rates was not reflected in reports from the second district for march and april business activity continued to expand in most sectors throughout the district several purchasing managers report very favorable conditions and the unemployment rate in new york reached a fouryear low the demand for homes is very strong and builders expect to be busy until the end of the year nonresidential construction is also strong with especially tight space availability in some parts of the district consumer spending did slow in march and despite a sharp recovery in april several retailers report excess inventories on the financial side banks have begun offering two new types of consumer loans variable rate installment loans and equity access accounts
3513,3513,5-8-1984,New York,Consumer Spending,retail sales in the second district were weak in march but rebounded in april two retailers located in new jersey registered sales lower in march than last year and several store chains reported very small increases in contrast consumer spending rose sharply in april throughout the district to amounts ranging from 11 to 26 percent higher than those of last year bad weather in march good weather in april and an easter holiday three weeks later than last year were common explanations for this patternthe increase in april sales was not enough to prevent excess inventory buildup for a number of retailers in the course of the past few months several stores have accumulated merchandise 20 or 30 percent over last years levels while much of the inventory growth was intentional levels at some stores were up to 10 percent higher than planned some retailers plan to reduce stocks by cutting back or canceling orders but others expect increased sales to absorb excess inventory
3514,3514,5-8-1984,New York,Business Activity,the business expansion in the second district maintained its pace in recent weeks purchasing managers in upstate areas reported quite favorable economic conditions and the percentage of managers in the buffalo area citing increases of new orders reached the highest level in six years downstate improved economic conditions made possible a new york city budget proposal calling for substantially higher levels of public employmentfurther employment gains were registered in many areas of the district march nonagricultural employment in new york state increased broadly to a record level for that month and the unemployment rate fell below 7 percent for the first time in four years the greatest improvements were in the construction trade service and financial industries manufacturing employment also rose as a pickup in business capital outlays led to increased employment in the electrical and nonelectrical machinery industriesamong major new construction projects in the district two of the largest were the groundbreaking for a new 300room hotel and convention center in the albany area and a planned office building and hotel near giants stadium in new jersey other large expansions include an additional building at ibms kingston new york complex increased space at a dairy plant and the enlargement of its headquarters building by a microwave firm
3515,3515,5-8-1984,New York,Construction and Real Estate,residential construction activity was brisk throughout the district despite occasional interruptions due to unseasonably wet weather demand is very strong and builders anticipate being booked through november because of anxiety over the future course of interest rates new york and new jersey builders are considering issuing builders bonds to finance mortgagee themselves in order to assure a stable flow of funds next yearnonresidential real estate activity also picked up a bit in recent months the strength in the manhattan office market which has recently been confined to older buildings is extending to new higherpriced office space demand is also up in new jersey and lower connecticut but remains fairly slow in the northern suburbs of new york on long island despite fears of large electricity rate hikes the industrial market was especially tight the amount of available industrial space fell by nearly 25 percent in the six months ending in marchnew office buildings are planned or starting both in new york city and in suburban areas construction of retail space especially strip centers along major roads is up on long island
3516,3516,5-8-1984,New York,Financial Developments,small second district banks are offering two relatively new consumer financial instruments variablerate consumer installment loans and equity access accounts most banks surveyed now offer variablerate consumer loans monthly payments are generally fixed for the term of the loan and quarterly rate adjustments are incorporated by changing the number of payments the response to these loans has been quite good the banks reported that up to 80 percent of consumer loans are now of the variable rate varietyequity access accounts are mortgage loans that can be accessed like lines of credit they are being offered by fewer banks and demand for these accounts appears to be fairly weak
3583,3583,6-25-1984,New York,Introduction,the pace of the recovery in the second district stabilized in may and early june business activity continued to expand in most sectors of the district and the unemployment rate fell in new jersey and remained below the national average in new york purchasing agents generally reported stable or improved business conditions a number of manufacturers were planning to modernize or expand their facilities and banks throughout the district reported rapid growth in business loan demand construction activity was strong and in the residential sector was at full capacity in some parts of the district consumer spending continued to meet or exceed retailers expectations
3584,3584,6-25-1984,New York,Consumer Spending,department stores in the second district posted better than expected sales gains during the month of may as consumer spending continued at the fast pace set in april though increases over last year varied from four to twenty one percent among individual retailers in most cases the volume of sales net or exceeded expectations retail sales during the first two weeks in june were also quite stronginventories at the end of may remained at high levels for many retailers ranging front fifteen to thirty percent above those posted last year some retailers view these levels as too high and have responded with markdowns and promotions other chains however have deliberately increased stocks because strong consumer demand is anticipated
3585,3585,6-25-1984,New York,Business Activity,growth in district business activity has continued but at a somewhat slower pace in recent weeks the percentage of purchasing agents reporting improved business conditions declined in may from aprils record levels and the percentage reporting higher inventories rose nevertheless most agents experienced stable or improved business conditions and they generally viewed the inventory buildup as reflecting increased confidence in the strength of the local economythe district continued to have a greater share of its labor force at work than the nation as a whole in may new york state unemployment remained at the april rate of 67 percent and new jersey unemployment dropped a full point to 57 percent the rate in new york city dropped slightly to 76 percent on an unadjusted basisseveral recent announcements painted to additional economic gains in various parts of the district plant shutdowns planned for northern new jersey and westchester have been cancelled instead one plant will be modernized and the other will be converted to mixed industrial uses in addition a 100 million plant expansion has begun in new jersey and on long island a 126 million international design center project has been initiated
3586,3586,6-25-1984,New York,Construction and Real Estate,residential construction activity remained very strong throughout the district however limited building capacity has reduced the pace of sales in spite of continued high levels of demand in fact some builder in parts at the district have suspended sales because they are unable to accommodate more businessnonresidential real estate activity was strong in most parts of the district in lower manhattan major institutions continued to seek large amounts of office space although some securities dealers and financial institutions have been moderating their expansion planslong island commercial and industrial construction was active and its relatively low rents continued to lure companies from new york cityconstruction also rained brisk in new jersey although sizable amounts of space are currently available construction in lover connecticut leveled off and activity in the northern suburbs of new york remained low
3587,3587,6-25-1984,New York,Financial Developments,during the past several months small banks in the second federal reserve district experienced rapid growth in business loan demand the reasons cited for the increase were the strength in the local economy inventory accumulation and leveraged buyouts of local business some of the regional bankers however expect loan demand to taper off in the next few months if the local economy slows down as expected or if there is another hike in the prime rate
3652,3652,8-6-1984,New York,Summary,although the second districts economy continued to expand through june and early july a few indications of some future slowing appeared consumer spending production and commercial and residential construction were all strong but higher interest rates on real estate loans have begun to discourage some marginal homebuyers and rising vacancy rates have caused some concern among commercial developers bringing new office space on line in the agricultural sector weather conditions have made the outlook discouraging
3653,3653,8-6-1984,New York,Consumer Spending,retail sales in the second district continued to exceed expectations of local merchants during the month of june though posted increases of between 10 and 20 percent over yearearlier levels were generally lower than those recorded for the previous two months for july estimates of sales increases varied widely among informants one retailer in new jersey reported only a five percent increase in sales over last year while another chain with mostly suburban outlets reported a gain of twentyeight percent by midjuly retailers inventories had generally fallen to planned levels stores having reduced the somewhat excessive stocks of may and june
3654,3654,8-6-1984,New York,Business Activity,the expansion in the districts business activity quickened somewhat in recent weeks a higher percentage of purchasing managers reported an improvement in new orders particularly in the rochester area and the percentage reporting lower orders declined inventories generally remained unchanged from the satisfactory levels of a month earlieremployment gains were registered in most of the districts labor market areas in june and the number of nonfarm jobs in new york state climbed above 75 million for the first time the improvement occurred across all industry categories but was most heavily concentrated among wholesale and retail trade establishments additional employment data suggest that the reported june increase in new york state unemployment from 67 to 71 percent was probably a statistical aberration as was new york citys increase from 7 to 10 percent
3655,3655,8-6-1984,New York,Financial Sector,although new york money center banks typically have offered higher rates on unregulated consumer deposits than the national average a rate war has broken out recently among these large new york city banks by july 25 the average yield on sixmonth deposits was up 132 basis points from five weeks earlier compared with 54 basis points nationally even with this runup in yields at money center banks there has not been any significant loss of consumer deposits at small institutions is the district
3656,3656,8-6-1984,New York,Construction and Real Estate,the strength of the housing market is beginning to diminish in most parts of the district higher mortgage rates have been depressing traffic especially among firsttime buyers and for lower and middlepriced houses homebuilders have experienced little adverse impact at present but the outlook for construction for spring deliveries is increasingly uncertain concerns about interest rates and growing inventories of vacant space are also beginning to affect commercial real estate markets in lower manhattan both supply and vacancy rates are increasing rapidly due to the completion of seven million square feet of office space on long island too a sizable amount of space is available or under construction
3657,3657,8-6-1984,New York,Agriculture,the agricultural picture has been adversely affected by weather conditions excessive rainfall and unusually cool weather delayed spring plating in mach of the district and lower vegetable and other crop production is likely this year dairy farmers report that milk prices have been relatively flat while costs continue to rise some increased demand for processed dairy products has occurred however
3725,3725,9-16-1984,New York,Introduction,second district retailers experienced a relatively weak summer but all other segments of the regional economy report continuing strong and stable growth department store sales generally failed to match expectations in july and early august for the first time in several months nevertheless new york banks are sharing in the nationwide surge of revolving credit loans homebuilders reported a strong market dominated by highincome buyers and significant numbers of cash customers and the suburban construction industry is generally working at capacity office space remains scarce in midtown manhattan but increasing vacancy rates are a concern elsewhere in the district the employment outlook in new york and new jersey is still improving as a result of the announcement of plans for more major expansion projects
3726,3726,9-16-1984,New York,Consumer Spending,retail sales in the second district were very soft during july and early august volume generally fell short of retailers expectations for the first time in several months local merchants reported july sales gains averaging only 5 percent over the same period a year ago and only one major retailer registered a very large increase in business in early august the weakness persisted shoppers were widely believed to be staying home to watch the olympic games most of our contacts reported improvements of varying magnitudes afterwards and sales figures for the entire month ranged from a decline of 1 percent to an increase of 17 percent inventories have been brought more in line with desired levels over the past two months with levels now averaging 20 percent aver last year as compared to nearly 30 percent in may and june however in light of recent soft sales retailers are still assessing their forecasts and their future inventory needs
3727,3727,9-16-1984,New York,Financial Developments,even with the slowdown in retail sales growth new york state banks report that both the number of active revolving credit accounts and the proportion of available credit lines drawn down have been expanding rapidly at the same time high interest rates have encouraged households to pay off balances at least as fast as or slightly faster than in the past and the proportions of delinquent accounts are at record low levels bankers attribute the rapid growth of revolving credit to the proliferation of new revolving credit instruments and the general strength of income and employment in this regions economy
3728,3728,9-16-1984,New York,Business Activity,economic conditions showed further moderate growth in the district during recent weeks upstate purchasing agents reported a modest expansion of new orders in august and inventories were generally at satisfactory levels the automotive industry remained strong a major producer began accepting job applications for the first time in four years and a tire manufacturer broke ground for a 100 million plant expansion additionally a 13 billion defense contract was awarded on long island and an electronics firm is moving some operations from the south to its facility in the schenectady area five television series are planned to begin production in new york city this fall and winterthe unemployment rate seasonally adjusted declined in both new york state and new jersey during august in contrast to the unchanged rate for the nation as a whole new yorks 77 percent was slightly above the us average of 75 percent while new jerseys rate of 6l percent remained below the nations
3729,3729,9-16-1984,New York,Construction and Real Estate,residential building activity remains brisk in the region and order books are largely filled for the year activity is limited by continuing shortages of skilled labor in new york city suburban areas ongoing construction has benefited from employment growth in highsalaried technology industries cash purchases and private financing have helped sustain the districts solid uppertier housing market even with increasing mortgage interest ratesnonresidential construction continued at its strong pace throughout most of the second district the major exception is midtown manhattan where lack of sites and high construction costs are restricting the supply of new space observers are looking to new development projects in places such as times square south midtown and the hudson river area to provide relief new yorks downtown vacancy rate continues to grow as new buildings are coming on line at the same time as the financial services industry has been weakening and demand for intown backoffice has been depressed by high prices on long island leasing activity remains brisk but observers are not certain that demand can keep pace with the amount of speculative construction activity
3796,3796,10-23-1984,New York,Introduction,economic activity in the second district grew moderately in recent weeks but at a slightly slower pace than in late consumer consumer spending continued to show improvement in september and early october and generally met the expectations of retailers most purchasing managers report growth or stability of new orders but a growing minority reported actual decreases business loan demand was mixed across banks and in the aggregate was essentially flat the office market softened in some areas while remaining strong in new york city homebuilders will be busy through the remainder of 1984 and in parts of the district are optimistic about next year
3797,3797,10-23-1984,New York,Consumer Spending,the pace of consumer spending in the second district shows continued improvement according to area retailers the strengthening in department store sales which began in late august has continued through the first week in october september sales gains varied widely among respondents averaging about 8 percent over levels of a year ago and generally matching expectations the region on average outperformed the nations sales growth but business in new york city was not as good as in the rest of the district inventories remained mostly on target averaging 15 percent over last year partly with the help of promotional markdowns however one higherincome department store chain reported inventories 22 percent over 1984 as a result of sluggish business since june
3798,3798,10-23-1984,New York,Business Activity,economic activity continued to expand in recent weeks but the pace is slowing reports by upstate purchasing managers indicated significantly slower growth of new orders and faster delivery times in september while the majority of firms faced conditions that were unchanged from the prior month or still improving the proportion reporting actual decreases of orders grew to nearly onethird in buffalo major plant construction or expansion projects were announced by several firms across the state such as manufacturers of electronics chemicals plastics and furniture the army will station a new division in economically depressed jefferson county generating up to 20000 construction jobs the unemployment rate in new york state seasonally adjusted fell from 77 percent in august to 70 percent in september while the new jersey rate held steady at 62 percentthe cost of electricity on long island is of growing concern the state commerce department reports that 400 firms have threatened to close or relocate in response to recent and expected future rate hikes associated with the shoreham nuclear plant
3799,3799,10-23-1984,New York,Financial Developments,business loan demand at regional banks in the second district has been mixed in recent weeks overall volume was essentially flat as has been the case nationwide borrowing by car dealers is reported to be down reflecting lowerthanusual inventories at the end of the model year in contrast service industry demand particularly by advertising agencies has been strong upstate bankers indicate that loan demand from the manufacturing sector was especially weak in western new york but was fairly strong in the syracuse area borrowing by retailers also was geographically mixed
3800,3800,10-23-1984,New York,Construction and Real Estate,residential construction is operating at capacity in the district and activity through the end of the year may be restrained only by unfavorable weather or shortages of skilled labor and subcontractors demand appears to be driven primarily by rising incomes and current interest rates seem to have little downward effect planning for 1955 is unusually active for october in new york citys northern suburbs homebuilders generally expect a repeat of this years strong performancethe office leasing market softened considerably in parts of the second district high levels of speculative construction are still taking place despite sluggish demand in areas such as fairfield county and northern new jersey on long island in spite of electricity rate fears demand is fairly strong but some observers question whether it will be sufficient to absorb the large amounts of space coming on line the market in midtown manhattan continues to be very active and the likelihood is increasing that prime space will be scarce and rents will rise by yearend downtown concern about potential oversupply seems to have abated demand seems stable and very large blocks of space are scarce still observers predict longer phasein periods for recently announced construction projects
3862,3862,12-5-1984,New York,Introduction,the pace of economic activity in the second district has been uneven in recent weeks retail sales slowed significantly in october and early november while purchasing managers reported significant improvement in business conditions in october after a sharp slowdown in september the first reports on the christmas season were mixed over the thanksgiving weekend department store sales were on or above plan but several retailers had advertised heavily and cut prices homebuilders remain busy and skilled labor is increasingly scarce the office market in contrast is weakening almost everywhere outside of midtown manhattan thus far the demand for mortgages and consumer loans has not responded to the recent decrease in interest rates
3863,3863,12-5-1984,New York,Consumer Spending,second district retailers report a weakening of consumer sales in october and november unseasonably warm weather was cited as the cause of the slow sales of winter clothing through most of the period yet only one merchant reported sharp increases when the weather cooled in midnovember as a result most stores report unplanned increases in their inventories over the thanksgiving weekend sales at many stores showed some improvement with increases over 1983 ranging from flat to 39 percent however the promotional environment has been escalating and some retailers reported needing aggressive advertising and price cuts
3864,3864,12-5-1984,New York,Business Activity,during recent weeks the pace of economic expansion showed some improvement after the september slowdown in rochester the percentage of purchasing managers reporting improved business conditions rose substantially in october in buffalo the percentage reporting declining orders fell inventories were steady to slightly higher and remain at satisfactory levels several new york firms plan to increase production end hiring as a result of newlyawarded government contracts and urban development grants additionally a japanese electronics firm will build a us headquarters complex in mahwah new jersey on the site of a large plant closed in 1980a recent report indicates that new york citys employment growth during the recovery extended to all five boroughs in contrast to past years when most job gains were concentrated in manhattan employment increases in brooklyn and the bronx reversed a sixyear pattern of decline
3865,3865,12-5-1984,New York,Construction and Real Estate,residential construction activity remains intense new contracts for home construction are being written by some upstate builders at a rate that exceeds even the rapid pace of last summer in downstate new york however a shortages of skilled labor in parts of the metropolitan area are reportedly worsening and the delays have been very costly to some homebuilders in parts of new jersey planning for multifamily housing is picking up as courtordered downzoning is gradually being implemented additionally for the first time in several years new york city is sponsoring the production of rental housing without federal subsidyobservers across the entire district however report slower absorption of office space in almost all areas with parts of westchester connecticut and new jersey especially sluggish potential renters of office space appear to be taking a wait and see stance before signing leases observers also believe that plans for many construction projects not yet started an likely to be postponed the one exception to this softening trend is in midtown manhattan where demand is still strong and inventories of rental spaces are low
3866,3866,12-5-1984,New York,Financial Developments,despite the drop in interest rates since august several regional banks said they experienced little or no increase in the demand for mortgages and consumer loans beyond the normal seasonal variation one reason mentioned for the weakness is that their mortgage end consumer loan rates have not dropped as much as open market interest rates and consumers are said to be delaying their borrowing in anticipation of a further decrease in the bank rates the banks also reported that for new mortgages fixed rate instruments have become more popular in the last few months
3930,3930,1-30-1985,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,introduction economic activity in the second district advanced at an uneven pace in recent weeks consumer spending strengthened during december and on into early january the demand for new homes was also strong and residential builders are quite optimistic about their prospects in 1985 while overall employment reached record levels district purchasing managers for the most part reported that production and new orders were unchanged in december the absorption of office space remains slow in many areas with vacancy rates showing little improvement
3931,3931,1-30-1985,New York,Consumer Spending,on balance december retail sales were strong in the second district despite some softness early in the period sales gains over december 1983 generally ranged between five and ten percent as area stores engaged in extensive advertising campaigns and heavy price markdowns retailers became apprehensive at the start of the month when spending slackened as the holidays approached however sales picked up considerably and continued at a brisk pace well into januarythe inventory situation among district retailers was mixed at year end while most reported stocks at comfortable levels some expressed the need to reduce excess inventories in the weeks ahead
3932,3932,1-30-1985,New York,Construction and Real Estate,residential construction activity remains strong while the arrival of cold weather has slowed the rate of exterior work interior subcontractors report a high level of activity even though this is usually their slack period optimism about the months ahead is high one electric utility for example has already received more orders to supply connections for housing subdivisions this year than in all of 1984 in addition in response to the heavy volume of customer traffic prices of new homes in some downstate areas are reported rising by as such as ten percent while lower mortgage rates have undoubtedly made homebuying more affordable their recent decline does not seem to be a major factor in the strength of district constructionthe absorption of new office space remains slow in many parts of the district and vacancy rates in these areas showed little improvement in northern new jersey westchester and fairfield counties observers report that markets are relatively soft and leasing activity is slow manhattan is a major exception where demand continues strong in midtown and some large space users recently signed leases in the downtown area another exception is long island where commercial leasing is described as fairly brisk with a resultant reduction of inventories there
3933,3933,1-30-1985,New York,Business Activity,the pace of the business expansion in the second district leveled off during recent weeks in december the majority of purchasing agents reported no change in business conditions while the percentages reporting gains or declines in new orders were virtually offsetting inventories are considered to be at satisfactory levels particularly after several weeks of paring by buffalo area firms district businessmen are generally optimistic about the outlook over the next six months though some expressed uncertainty about the overall economyplans for several new or expanded industrial projects have recently been announced among these are a record 554 million in capital expenditures scheduled by a rochester manufacturer for 1985 a 200 million natural gas cogeneration plant to be built in syracuse and a 125 million expansion by an upstate paper maker in addition the port authority of new york and new jersey and the new jersey economic development authority plan to convert several buildings which were abandoned when firms left yonkers and elizabeth into two new industrial parksemployment continues at record high levels in new york and new jersey moreover during 1984 new york city had its largest employment gain since recordkeeping began in 1950 december unemployment rates were at or below the national seasonally adjusted rate of 73 percent in both new york state and new jersey
3934,3934,1-30-1985,New York,Financial Developments,despite the continued strength of district housing activity some upstate commercial banks report no upturn as yet in the demand for mortgage loans seasonal elements have been suggested as an explanation of at least part of the sluggish demand in same areas relatively high unemployment rates have also been cited banks seem confident however that continued lower mortgage rates should reverse this pattern in the first quarter of 1985
3998,3997,3-12-1985,New York,Introduction,the districts uneven economic expansion has continued the pace of consumer spending was mixed in recent weeks with some suburban retailers report reporting continued strength and others noting weak sales even with aggressive promotional activity there were a few signs that the pace of the districts business expansion may be slowing but so far the employment picture has been quite good the housing market remained robust with construction only delayed by bad weather the demand for office space has been picking up in much of the district although inventories remained high small banks reported continued strength of commercial and industrial loan demand
3999,3998,3-12-1985,New York,Consumer Spending,retail business in the second district was mixed in recent weeks in a highly promotional environment most chains doing business in suburban areas especially discounters continued to fare well some merchants however reported weakness in january and into february sales for one new york city merchant fell during the period despite deep price markdowns and an upstate new york retailer indicated that sales rose only moderately in part due to heavy snowstorms inventories have been brought down to desired levelsto about 10 percent above 1984s holdingsat most stores contacted one department store chain however reported continued growth of its stocks to nearly 20 percent above last years level and has further reduced its orders for spring merchandise
4000,3999,3-12-1985,New York,Business Activity,the second districts business expansion has continued but its pace appeared to be slowing while a majority of purchasing agents still reported either stable or improved business conditions in january there was also a sizable increase in the number of agents whose new orders had declined businessmen seemed somewhat less optimistic than they did last month inventories however were currently deemed by most to be at satisfactory levelsthe employment picture remained very strong although there were a few early signs of a possible slowdown employment in both new york and new jersey remained at record high levels unemployment rates were well below the national average and several major employers have indicated their intention either to maintain or to increase employment in the district during 1985 however layoffs and plant closings have become somewhat more prevalent firms announcing contractions included a drug manufacturer in northern new jersey a typewriter maker and a bottle manufacturer in upstate new york and an aerospace producer on long island
4001,4000,3-12-1985,New York,Construction and Real Estate,cold weather has temporarily slowed residential construction activity the demand for houses however has remained robust builders in many parts of the district expected 1984s record levels of activity to continue throughout 1985the housing market nay be affected by several bills pending before state legislatures in new york the renewal of rent regulations and various tax incentives are being considered new jerseys legislature is debating action on courtordered lowincome housing construction in suburban areas proposed bills in both states would also increase subsidies for low and middleincome housing construction directly and through reducedinterest mortgagesreal estate brokers in many parts of the area noted that the nonresidential real estate market has stabilized in recent weeks even though inventories were on the high side the demand for office space has increased in downtown manhattan owing in part to the recent strength of the stock market and the banking sector leasing activity was high in midtown manhattan and on long island in contrast demand was weak in northern new jersey and fairfield county in connecticut and observers believed that the large extent of speculative building underway in these areas has not been warranted by the current rate of space absorption westchester county new york has been an intermediate case demand was viewed as satisfactory but large additions of new space next spring nay upset the current equilibrium
4002,4001,3-12-1985,New York,Financial Developments,commercial and industrial loan growth at small banks remained fairly strong in recent weeks in contrast to the continuing contraction at major new york city banks according to the small banks contacted the strength of loan demand came in response to a reduction in loan rates that was prompted by strong deposit inflows at lower interest rates industries with particularly strong loan demand included small manufacturers homebuilders and a wide variety of small businesses respondents expected this level of activity to continue for at least the next three months
4064,4063,5-6-1985,New York,Introduction,economic activity in the second district has continued to expand at an erratic pace department store sales softened in parts of the district particularly in new york city business activity improved somewhat as new development projects and expansions outnumbered plant closings and layoffs homebuilders continued to operate at full speed impeded only by scarce labor and materials the districts office markets were mixed with strength in midtown manhattan and long island stability in westchester county and northern new jersey and weakness in downtown manhattan and southwestern connecticut large new york city banks have been facing relatively modest asset growth in contrast small banks reported that the strength in the regions economy has led to strong demand for home mortgages automobile financing and business loans
4065,4064,5-6-1985,New York,Consumer Spending,department stores reported that the rate of consumer spending had slowed appreciably in parts of the district in february sales generally met expectations and were about 10 percent over last years levels sales in march however fell significantly below expected levels for two department store chains and early reports for april reflected continuing softenings it appeared that new york city retailers faced the weakest sales while some suburban and upstate new york merchants reported continuing gains inventories have been kept in check by most stores contacted but one merchant facing persistently weak sales reported stocks that were above plan and rising
4066,4065,5-6-1985,New York,Business Activity,business conditions for the districts industrial firms have improved somewhat in recent weeks in rochester more firms reported increased orders than in earlier months for buffalo improving conditions have not become any more widespread but the number of firms reporting worsening conditions was down significantly in general desired inventories have been rising lately perhaps reflecting the improved outlook for sales many firms reportedalthough some layoffs and plant closings continued there was a significant increase in announcements of new development projects and expansions an automobile producer will spend over 100 million to refurbish and retool a stamping plant in buffalo another auto plant is recalling its night shift of 2200 workers in tarrytown also planned are a large computer center in rockland county a new chemical facility in western new york a power plant near albany and the expansion of a ship terminal on staten islandin the aggregate however manufacturing remains a weak spot even with record high employment levels in new york state the largest plant closing announced recently was a syracuse chemical plant which will eliminate 1400 jobs beginning early next year
4067,4066,5-6-1985,New York,Construction and Real Estate,commercial real estate activity continued to vary markedly by location and type of user the demand for office space was strong in midtown manhattan and long island steady in northern new jersey and westchester county and weak in downtown manhattan and southwest connecticut brokers in manhattan new jersey and connecticut reported strong demand among small space users but surprisingly low activity for midsized spaces demand for large spaces in midtown manhattan remained strong especially in the services sector downtown in contrast net space absorption has fallen to zero in recent months in nassau county long island conversion of space to office and retail uses has made space very scarce for industrial firmsthe housing market was little changed from activity levels prevailing for the past year builders remained very busy in many parts of the district and several faced scarcity of skilled labor or lumber and sheetrock the outlook for the next six months is for continued strength in new york city the first 800 apartments to be built with funds from the states municipal assistance corporation have been scheduled for construction this summer
4068,4067,5-6-1985,New York,Financial Developments,large new york city banks showed relatively modest growth of assets but reports from small banks in the second district indicated that the demand for several categories of loans has been growing rapidly over the past few months more in line with national trends the demand for home mortgages has been especially strong owing to the regions robust market for new homes the increasing demand for automobile financing was a major factor in the rapid expansion of consumer credit business loan activity has also increased rapidly spurred by strength of economic activity across all industrial categories
4132,4131,6-25-1985,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,activity in most sectors of the second district economy slowed in recent weeks sluggishness of consumer spending has continued for the last few months although many stores in the area were still doing somewhat better than for the nation as a whole fewer firms reported improving business conditions than did earlier in the year commercial real estate brokers indicated growing concern that their boom my be over a major bright spot was in residential construction where homebuilders reported the best market conditions in years on the financial side consumer loan rates began to decline reflecting the trend in general market interest rates
4133,4132,6-25-1985,New York,Consumer Spending,the pace of consumer spending in the second district continued to slow over the last two months although several retailers reported that business in the metropolitan area was slightly better than in other parts of the nation gains over 1984 averaged only about 2 percent for april and 4 percent for may sales for some merchants continued to fall short of expectations by significant margins nevertheless inventories were generally close to planned levels and promotions continued at a normal pace with few special price markdowns one department store chain however reported especially weak sales even with extensive promotions and was returning some unsold summer merchandise to suppliers
4134,4133,6-25-1985,New York,Business Activity,the erratic business expansion seems to have slowed recently in the district while the majority of purchasing agents still reported improved or stable business conditions fewer firm reported improvements in may in buffalo moreover more firms indicated that new orders had fallen in line with this moderation of economic activity firms have been undertaking inventory reductions in recent weeksmajor capital investment projects continued to be announced however including two joint ventures involving foreign investors toshiba and westinghouse will retool and restaff an elmira plant which had been closed for nine years to produce tv tubes and computer display screens in addition the government of yugoslavia will participate in a project to convert part of bethlehem steels abandoned lackawana plant to an aluminum mill these undertakings would add several hundred jobs to areas facing persistently high unemployment ratesother large projects recently begun or announced in the district include the construction of a new shopping mall and the expansion of two existing ones in niagara county as well as a new financial center and corporate headquarters in downtown albany
4135,4134,6-25-1985,New York,Construction and Real Estate,residential construction activity remained robust with builders and suppliers reporting the best market conditions in many years lower mortgage rates have added an additional stimulus in recent weeks according to our contacts home prices have risen above yearearlier levels sharply in some areas the outlook for the rest of the year is for continued strength and some homebuilders already are optimistic about l986 skilled labor remained scarce in some areas and some construction schedules have been delayed observers in various parts of the district also reported price increases for developed lots lumber or other materialsthe new york city government has proposed major zoning revisions to reduce the construction costs for apartment houses the changes could encourage the construction of up to 5000 now units annually at 25 percent below current costs according to the citys estimatesreal estate brokers are becoming concerned that the boom in the regions office market may be over availability rates remain very high over 20 percent in some areas yet net absorption is not increasing the outlook is uncertain with the strength of commercial construction depending on the performance of the general economy in the coming monthsour contacts also expressed uncertainty regarding the impact of the presidents tax proposals most agreed that real estate would be a less attractive investment especially to small investors and syndications a slower pace of investment could depress property values at least in the short run but one observer was optimistic about the longerterm stimulus of the tax plan some brokers also believed that investment in manhattan and long island might be discouraged to some extent by the elimination of state and local tax deductibility fairfield county connecticut and northern new jersey might derive some relative benefit
4136,4135,6-25-1985,New York,Financial Developments,consumer lending rates began to recede from their recent high levels reflecting the downward trend in market interest rates some commercial banks in the district already have cut consumer rates and our contacts all agreed that the spread between consumer and market rates will narrow soon auto loan rates appeared to have fallen the most sharply and bankers expect this downward trend to continue rates on personal loans have fallen only slightly and remain very high but are expected to decline further in contrast credit card rates have not declined and are not expected to fall in the near future bankers attributed the reluctance to lower finance charges to high operating costs
4201,4200,8-6-1985,New York,Introduction,the economic expansion in the second district continues to be uneven consumer spending remains sluggish but there is some evidence of improvement in july levels of business activity vary across the district with signs of strength in rochester and weakness in buffalo two large automotive projects will bolster the otherwise difficult conditions in regional manufacturing sectors office markets are generally quiet as is usual at this time of year but extensive inventories are prompting landlord concessions and contacts are uncertain about the fall outlook the districts housing market continues to boom however and real estate portfolios of regional banks reflect this strength
4202,4201,8-6-1985,New York,Retail Sales,the prolonged softness of district retail sales has continued in recent weeks with average spending only 2 percent above last year the weakness persists despite intensive promotions and heavy price markdowns at many stores sales fell short of expectations by as such as 8 percent in june even though some merchants lowered their forecasts as recently as may new york city sales are especially weak and one store reports a decline to 4 percent below 1984 sales levels suburban outlets report modest gains but still smaller than anticipated while most merchants are satisfied with inventory levels one store reports stocks 10 percent above plan and little success in moving its merchandiseexplanations for this spending slump include uncertainties concerning tax proposals increased travel and shopping abroad and reduced foreign tourism here additionally some retailers think that consumers are waiting for further price cuts many report that early july figures suggest substantial improvement but the data are too sketchy for them to call it a turning point
4203,4202,8-6-1985,New York,Business Activity,as was the case last month the pace of the business expansion varies widely across the region rochesters economy continues to pick up with growing numbers of purchasing managers reporting sales gains and very few reporting declines in contrast fewer buffalo firms report improvement in june and more indicate a drop in business syracuses gain from empire airlines recent decision to consolidate operations there may be to some extent uticas loss some suburban areas such as long island and fairfield county connecticut report scarcity of lowskilled labor in fact mcdonalds restaurants in stamford are busing 150 workers daily from the bronx overall the districts unemployment rate remains below the national averagetwo major projects announced by general motors were welcome news to regional manufacturing sectors general motors will spend nearly 500 million to modernize and retool its linden new jersey facility and to rebuild a plant in tarrytown new york meanwhile ground was broken in rochester for a complex of offices small businesses and a hotel about 1000 jobs will eventually be located there
4204,4203,8-6-1985,New York,Construction and Real Estate,vacancy rates in the districts office markets remain high across the district a buyers market has developed and landlord concessions such as a period of free rent and leasehold improvements are common in northern new jersey demand has been flat for the last six months and vacancy rates are as high as one third around the district observers are unsure whether the autumns normal seasonal upturn in demand will materialize due to questions about the economy tax reform and the value of the dollarinvestment banks have been important in real estate recently dean witter will rent one million square feet in the world trade center that the new york state government will be vacating prompt leasing of such a large block has relieved some realtor concern over the generally weak demand for space in new buildings morgan stanley plans to lease 220000 square feet in brooklyn pending special state subsidies the midtown manhattan core of office space has been widening in recent years but this is the first major office project across the east riverthe districts housing markets continue to boom homebuilding in rochester has been especially active and the syracuse builders association canceled its annual home show as unnecessary prices continue to rise in many areas and land skilled labor and some materials remain in short supply delayed completions have resulted prolonging the period of heavy demand many builders expect this strong pace to continue at least through yearend
4205,4204,8-6-1985,New York,Financial Developments,the regions strongerthanaverage housing market is also benefiting area banks our contacts in the district observe none of the real estate problems reported in the national press delinquencies on their real estate loans are not rising nor is the value of their mortgage collateral falling area banks expect the solvency of borrowers to improve as variable rate mortgages adjust downward and highcost fixed rate loans are refinanced at lower rates
4267,4266,9-16-1985,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,most sectors of the second district economy are currently showing little growth in activity and our contacts views of the outlook are varied with retail sales slow except in cases of heavy promotional activity merchants voice little optimism about the autumn business activity is seasonally slack in a number of areas but some firms continue to make investments and others anticipate a pickup in orders office availability rates are generally high though demand for office space in some areas is relatively strong by contrast the housing market remains quite active and small district banks report no problems with consumer or mortgage loan delinquencies
4268,4267,9-16-1985,New York,Consumer Spending,as yet there is no sign that district retail spending will overcome its recent sluggishness one major chain reports july sales were 35 percent below last years level while another had only a disappointing 25 percent gain some stores did register increases in excess of 10 percent but only with extremely heavy promotional activity and low profitability a spokesman for one of these stores believes consumers have become accustomed to promotional markdowns and now avoid buying at full price this is more of a problem for department stores than for discountersopinions about the current state of inventories are varied one of our contacts is satisfied with a 13 percent increase since his stocks are clean of leftover springsummer goods however another chain finds a 10 percent increase unsatisfactory because sales levels are down a third chain had to trim inventories by 6 percent in order to meet its plan district retailers are not very optimistic about the outlook given the lessthanrobust state of the national economy they are concerned that consumers will remain cautious and sales gains will only come through further heavy promotions
4269,4268,9-16-1985,New York,Business Activity,second district economic activity showed no clear direction in recent weeks on one hand buffalo purchasing managers report a slight improvement in new orders during july coupled with stable or lower inventory levels on the other hand a higher percentage of rochester area firms report slower business conditions and a buildup in inventories due to seasonal factors despite current conditions rochester purchasing managers anticipate a pickup in business activity during the next few monthsin contrast the unemployment situation has improved markedly the july unemployment rate of 61 percent in new york state was 2 percentage points lower than a year earlier new york city had an even larger drop from 115 to 69 percent new jerseys unemployment rate currently 60 percent has been below the national level for more than a yearmajor investments continue to establish a base for future economic expansion ground was broken recently in the first phase of a 30 million dunkirk harbor development project in western new york and construction was started on two new hotels in that same vicinity plans have also been announced for a 650000 square foot shopping mall and a 28 million hightech research and development plant in rochester in addition through government assistance end taxexempt financing two abandoned manufacturing facilities will soon reopen 1 an employeeowned castings firm will modernize a binghamton area foundry which closed in 1982 and 2 a rail car assembly plant will open at the former otis elevator site in yonkers
4270,4269,9-16-1985,New York,Construction and Real Estate,residential construction activity remains strong in the district in response to continued heavy demand in some areas lower mortgage rates are cited as a major factor shortages of skilled labor and certain materials still delay scheduled completions and speculative home building is generally at a minimum builders expect to maintain this busy pace at least through yearend home prices continue to move higher in much of the district but in manhattan luxury coop and condo prices have begun to ease an autumn 1985 cutoff date for certain city tax abatements prompted an unusually heavy volume of new multifamily building this year in manhattanthe districts nonresidential real estate market remains seasonally inactive availability rates are at relatively high levels in a number of areas and concessions by sellers and landlords continue to prevail in much of the district moreover in northern new jersey and fairfield county demand for office space is limited to small users some areas of relative strength do exist however in rochester for example contacts report that office construction is reported robust with no current vacancy problems in downtown and midmanhattan the leasing of new office space is proceeding at a satisfactory pace
4271,4270,9-16-1985,New York,Financial Developments,while consumer credit and mortgage loan delinquencies rose sharply nationally in late 1984 and early 1985 at small district banks consumer credit delinquencies have not increased and mortgage delinquencies have risen only slightly in many cases consumer delinquencies have actually shown an overtheyear decline in general delinquencies are not expected to become a problem and small district banks do not plan to toughen or change their lending policies some banks attributed stable delinquency rates to the development and maintenance of close client relationships they also cited lower interest rates and conservative eligibility guidelines
4335,4334,10-23-1985,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,some signs of a pickup in the second district economy have appeared in recent weeks retailers report that august sales were the best in several months and they attribute the slowdown in september to unseasonably warm weather and hurricane gloria business activity is generally described as stable or improved despite continued layoffs by some manufacturers who are consolidating operations outside the district commercial leasing activity has increased in most areas but office availability rates are still high throughout the district the demand for new homes remains strong small banks in the district report a decline in car loans due to lower cost financing by auto manufacturers
4336,4335,10-23-1985,New York,Consumer Spending,retail sales in august averaged 9 percent above yearearlier levels the first substantial advance after a prolonged period of sluggishness brisk backtoschool business and a betterthanexpected response to new fall fashions were cited as major factors as a result some stores posted their first aboveplan sales figures in several months preliminary data indicate some slowing during september but this was generally attributed to summerlike weather and the impact of hurricane gloria however one discountchain contact suggested that the high level of consumer debt is hindering sales of its durable goods and another retailer speculated that auto promotions have reduced general merchandise salesafter several months of heavy promotional activity most department stores had trimmed their inventories to desired levels by the end of july inventories have remained on target and district retailers are generally optimistic about the fall and holiday seasons ahead some are already stockpiling possible hotselling items such as cabbage patch dolls and robot transformers
4337,4336,10-23-1985,New York,Business Activity,economic activity in the second district was stable to somewhat improved in recent weeks in both buffalo and rochester for example an increased percentage of purchasing managers reported that business conditions were either unchanged or better during august inventories there remain at comfortable levels in other parts of new york state and new jersey conditions were also described as generally stable although some manufacturing firms continue laying off regional workers and consolidating operations outside the district in an attempt to become more competitive passaic new jersey was a major exception to this pattern of stability a widespread fire in its industrial area recently destroyed 62 small plants which employed 2200 workerswhile the september unemployment rates remained below the national average in new york state and new jersey some employment cutbacks are expected in the district as a result of restructuring plans recently announced by att information systems and union carbide in addition the redesign of an automotive plant in new jersey will temporarily reduce employment in that sector by 4200 workers over the next 1216 monthsthe overall effect on employment is difficult to project however since other firms continue to move into and expand within the district major investments recently announced included the purchase of a former western electric plant in new jersey for conversion to an industrial park the approval of the 15 million first step in the port authority of new york and new jerseys 500 million waterfront project in new york city and the purchase by local investors of two buffalo area plants assuring the retention of at least 2200 jobs and perhaps the addition of othersconstruction and real estate district homebuilders report no letup in the busy pace of their activity demand for new homes remains strong and the rush is on to complete as much work as possible before cold weather arrives in addition in connecticut and long island where hurricane gloria was especially damaging the demand for skilled labor and building supplies has increased even more as a result extensive delays in rebuilding and repairs have been noted there most district homebuilders expect residential construction to continue strong at least through early next year however they anticipate a somewhat less hectic pace than in 1985nonresidential leasing activity has picked up in much of the district observers in westchester and fairfield counties report an increase in leases signed and in northern new jersey the number of leasing inquiries is rising in many areas however the supply of office space still greatly exceeds demand opinion is divided about the direction of the downtown manhattan market although the availability rate there has increased it remains among the nations lowestfinancial developments the special incentive financings offered by auto manufacturers have reduced car lending activity at small district banks especially in august and september since the cost of raising funds has not declined recently for small district banks they were unable to match the rate reductions offered by finance companies although some banks noted that lending has begun to pick up a new round of incentive financing on autos is expected soon

4470,4469,1-28-1986,New York,Construction and Real Estate,residential construction remains strong in the district and respondents found no evidence in their areas of the sharp dropoff in november housing starts reported for the northeast in the syracuse area for example november starts were virtually unchanged from a year earlier and starts through the first 11 months of 1985 equaled the fullyear record set there in 1978 due in part to mild weather home builders in various parts of the district began the new year at a good pace most now expect activity in 1986 to equal or surpass 1985 at least through late summer however they said that rising interest rates or unfavorable tax legislation could change this scenariowhile office market conditions were generally stable in northern new jersey increased leasing activity and a slowing of new projects have taken some of the slack out of the market in new york city additional financial firms are expanding outside manhattan citicorp proposed construction of an office complex in queens that would be the largest ever built in the outer boroughs at the same time a second financial services firm has announced plans to locate some of its operations in an area now under development in brooklyn

4540,4539,3-20-1986,New York,Financial Developments,mortgage rates at small second district banks have been trending down for several months but they do not yet reflect the sharp drop in market rates since midfebruary fixed rate mortgages are still in the 11 to 12 percent range but are expected to come down in the near future the consensus among bankers is that the expectation of further rate declines is keeping mortgage demand relatively constant and forestalling any sizable shift out of adjustable rate mortgages refinancings account for as much as 40 to 50 percent of business at some banks but this percentage has been relatively stable over the past few years

4688,4687,6-24-1986,New York,Construction and Real Estate,homebuilders in the second district are very busy in fact the biggest problem for many is keeping up with demand lower mortgage rates are cited as a primary factor behind the strong buyer interest at this time a record year for housing starts is forecast in some new jersey areas and in western new york the biggest housing boom in 10 years is reportedly underway however upward pressure on prices is resulting in some areas from a growing shortage of suitable lots and certain types of skilled labor retain in short supplythe second district commercial real estate market has stabilized in recent weeks while rent concessions remain widespread and inventory levels continue high in some areas no additional softening seems to have occurred vacancy rates have also shown little change recently observers anticipate some improvement however because the number of plans for new office space is declining in areas of excess supply such as northern new jersey and fairfield county
4689,4688,6-24-1986,New York,Financial Developments,many small banks in the second district report that the number of their credit card accounts has grown somewhat in the past few months despite high rates and a large amount of consumer indebtedness a few banks noted however that they had also raised their minimum payment requirements and the volume of their outstanding credit card debt has not increased much as a result the growth in the number of accounts is partly attributed to increased advertising and the development of cards targeted at specific occupations and income levels growth at some banks has also resulted partly from the acquisition of competitors facilities a few banks in contrast report that their share of the credit card market has been eroded by money center banks and they have responded by lowering rates and fees and by lengthening grace periods
4760,4759,8-5-1986,New York,Overview,in recent weeks the economic expansion in the second district varied across sectors retailers reported consumer spending at or above planned levels during june and early july and demand for new housing remained strong leasing activity in the commercial real estate market was not uniform however and business conditions were also mixed delinquency rates on consumer loans at small district banks mirrored the national trend leveling off in the first quarter following the earlier increase

4764,4763,8-5-1986,New York,Financial Developments,small banks in the second district report that delinquency rates on consumer installment loans have mirrored the national trend rising in 1984 and early 1985 and leveling off through the first quarter of 1986 delinquency rates at some small district banks had been running above the national average however in the first quarter of 1986 rates at all surveyed banks had fallen below the national average most banks attribute the recent improvement to expanded facilities for verifying borrowers income and credit history and to enhanced collection efforts several banks added that they are raising credit standards lowering listings on revolving loans and purchasing better quality loans
4835,4834,9-10-1986,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,in general the second district economy registered a modest improvement since the last report most retailers had sales gains that were at or above plan residential construction remained strong and business activity showed some pickup demand for office space was slack as usually is the case this time of year and few new projects were announced over the past year small district banks have experienced increased competition from larger banking organizations in the market for business loans
4836,4835,9-10-1986,New York,Consumer Spending,consumer spending was stronger than had been expected at several district stores during july and most retailers reported satisfactory gains in sales as a result inventories are currently at or below planned levels throughout the region higher priced stores registered sales growth of 1119 percent well above plan in some cases while sales at mediumpriced retailers grew between 6 and 12 percent discount stores were the only major group with lowerthanexpected gains of just 34 percentwhile july is traditionally a month in which retailers clear out summer stock sales of apparel were particularly strong during the recent period in addition a pickup in demand for consumer durables was also noted with one store reporting exceptional sales of furniture and rugs continuing interest on the part of foreign visitors was cited as an important factor in the improved consumer spending particularly in new york city industry sources attribute this increased foreign buying to the decline in the value of the dollar
4837,4836,9-10-1986,New York,Business Activity,economic conditions in the second district were somewhat better in recent weeks the percentage of rochester purchasing managers reporting an improved business situation increased during july groundbreaking ceremonies were recently held at new jerseys first trashtoenergy power plant electricity produced there will be purchased by a major utility in the area a large pharmaceutical firm in new jersey has also undertaken a multimilliondollar expansion of its research and development laboratory which should result in additional employment by 1987 other recently announced plans include the construction of a frozen food factory in central new york which a british food manufacturer will begin this fall and the building of an aircraft parts facility on long islandin upstate new york some 2000 of an expected 10000 soldiers have already arrived at fort drum where a new army division is being assembled the pentagon plans to spend some 1 billion on construction in the area and the addition of these soldiers and their families is expected to provide a significant stimulus to the regional economy this should offset to some extent the impact of gms recently announced plans to lay off or transfer 1200 of its foundry workers in that area over the next two years
4838,4837,9-10-1986,New York,Construction and Real Estate,homebuilders remain busy throughout the second district but conditions are somewhat less hectic than in the spring and early summer when buyer activity peaked a major problem continues to be getting homes completed on time since certain types of skilled labor are still in short supply in some areas particularly where the stock of suitable land is almost depleted a substantial increase in home prices has also been noted in manhattan however where a large amount of apartment building is underway that was started prior to the november 1985 cutoff date for city tax abatement some observers question the viability of the high prices and rentals that will be asked for the new unitsthe second district commercial real estate market has shown little change in recent weeks and conditions remain somewhat mixed only a few major new projects have been announced as most areas adjust to the ample supply of office space currently available leasing activity has been seasonally slow in many areas and the prolonged sluggishness in northern new jersey persists some pickup has been noted in manhattan however where a major brokerage firm recently announced that it will occupy the last of the world trade center buildings in its entirety throughout the district observers anticipate that the new tax reform bill will curtail the pace of speculative office building
4839,4838,9-10-1986,New York,Financial Developments,small and midsized banks in the second district report that competition in the business loan market from larger banking organizations has increased over the past year most of the increase has been from large regional banks and smaller bank holding companies rather than from money center banks the responses from those surveyed suggest that only those banks large enough to service midsized companies have been affected moreover the intensity of the competition seemed to increase directly with the size of the bank surveyed while most banks indicated that all types of business loans were equally affected a few felt that the commercial mortgage sector had received special attention the competition has taken the form of increased advertising and direct solicitation of borrowers among the steps which the small banks have taken to preserve their share of the commercial lending market are faster handling and approval of loans greater customer contact and increased efforts to match though not undercut competitors rates
4902,4901,10-23-1986,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the second districts economy showed some modest improvement in recent weeks retailers had sales gains that were generally higher than expected end residential construction continued strong business activity was stable to improved while some seasonal pickup in the demand for office space occurred as the general level of interest rates has declined small district banks report increased pressure to reduce their lending rates
4903,4902,10-23-1986,New York,Consumer Spending,consumer spending was stronger than expected at a number of district stores during august and september and retailers reported sales gains well above target sales were bolstered by domestic tourists who continued visiting the district to view the refurbished statue of liberty and by foreign buyers responding to the dollars decline as a result of strong sales inventories are currently at or below desired levels in each of the regionduring august overtheyear sales growth in the district ranged from 1020 while september gains were in a 1015 range one retail chain attributed a betterthanaverage showing among its stores in the district to more favorable local weather and fewer major economic problems such as those currently affecting the farm and oil regions among those items generally cited as in strong demand recently were hone furnishings mens and womens apparel and various kinds of accessorieswith regard to the outlook a recent survey conducted by a national accounting firm of some 250 upstate retailers indicated widespread optimism concerning sales gains and control over inventories in the fall and holiday seasons
4904,4903,10-23-1986,New York,Business Activity,the improved tone in the second districts economy continued during recent weeks though few additional gains have been noted purchasing managers in the rochester area for example report that their economy remains strong with 88 percent of them characterizing general business conditions as stable or improved in september and in the albany area while some businessmen described the local economy as plateaued others pointed to a pickup in business conditions during the third quarteroverall employment has expanded further in the district though the manufacturing sector continues to contract the september unemployment rates in new york and new jersey were 61 percent and 47 percent respectively well below the national average in addition the overtheyear declines in the new york and new jersey unemployment rates of half a percentage point surpassed the 01 percentage point national decline concerning the future with congress currently debating whether or not to fund further production of jet trainer planes at fairchild republic considerable apprehension exists among the 3500 long island employees whose jobs at that plant are at stake
4905,4904,10-23-1986,New York,Construction and Real Estate,the pace of activity among district homebuilders is still vigorous with apparently no letup in sight builders are encountering no shortage of buyers though in some areas they continue to have difficulty in completing construction on time skilled labor remains in short supply in these areas and the problem may worsen since many summer workers have returned to college home prices continue rising and reportedly as a result for the first time in several years some upstate builders are engaged in speculative construction since demand remains strong these builders prefer to sell after completion in anticipation of securing a higher price than could be obtained by signing a contract in advancesome seasonal pickup in commercial and industrial leasing activity has occurred in recent weeks but conditions in the second district have otherwise shown little change leasing activity in downtown manhattan reportedly is somewhat stronger than in midtown as demand for space in new financial district buildings remains strong a more than ample supply of office space remains in northern new jersey and fairfield and westchester counties however westchester has recently been experiencing a flurry of leasing activity as several large firms from outside the county have taken space
4906,4905,10-23-1986,New York,Financial Developments,small and midsize banks in the second district report increasing pressure to lower their lending rates as other interest rates have declined in part the pressure exists because many bank loans such as corporate loans commercial mortgages and some consumer loans are directly linked to the prime rate in addition competition has been particularly strong for home equity and automobile loans despite a lowering of their home and auto loan rates however several banks have found their share of these markets considerably reduced moreover as rates on business and consumer loans declined so did the spread between interest earned and that paid on deposit accounts as a result surveyed banks have been lowering the rates they pay on variable rate accountscds nows and money market accounts most expect a further narrowing of the interest rate spread as their higher earning securities and mortgages mature consequently some banks are considering lowering rates on fixed rate accounts such as passbook savings despite widespread reluctance to pursue this option

4975,4974,12-1-1986,New York,Financial Developments,small banks in the second district report that home equity lines of credit currently represent only a small portion of their outstanding consumer loans while all of the surveyed banks have increased their efforts to market the product each expected only moderate growth in its volume of these loans through 1987 several banks believe that more rapid growth would be restrained by competition from other banks and nonbanks and also by a continued surge in second mortgages and refinancing arrangements loan officers state that the most common uses of the credit line include consolidating debt financing education and providing additional cash flow for business the banks suggested that they can prevent consumers from using the line of credit as a proxy for other types of consumer loans by providing counseling and by maintaining high underwriting standards however only one bank indicated that it required its applicants to provide information on how the money is to be used and none used this type of information as a criterion for lending

5041,5040,1-28-1987,New York,Business Activity,the second districts economic expansion slowed somewhat in recent weeks most purchasing managers in buffalo and rochester continue to report stable to improved new orders and production however the percentage of firms with declining business conditions has been rising and in november such firms surpassed the number with improved situations for the first tine in several monthsemployment remains at a record level in the district as declines in manufacturing have continued being offset by gains in other sectors moreover the december unemployment rates of 43 and 60 percent in new jersey and new york respectively were below the national average however a development that could have an adverse impact on district employment is at ts recently announced plans for a 27400 reduction in its workforce by the end of 1987 while no information was given as to where the cutbacks would occur some 67000 of the companys employees are in the new yorknew jersey area
5042,5041,1-28-1987,New York,Construction and Real Estate,residential construction continues to be strong in the second district aided by the lack of frost and unusually warm weather builders have remained quite active working on contracts from the fall a scarcity of suitable land is a growing problem in some areas and rising home prices are widespread developers are increasingly resorting to subdivisions in order to keep house prices at affordable levels despite these problems builders are generally optimistic that 1987s activity will come close to matching the busy pace of 1986office market conditions were relatively stable in recent weeks with few major new projects undertaken additional leasing activity continues to help in areas of oversupply moreover some observers anticipate an actual tightening of the office market on long island because of the unabated demand and limited construction activity there in manhattan opinions are mixed concerning the likely impact of the recent collapse of rental negotiations for the last of the world trade buildings some anticipate a sizable increase in the downtown vacancy rate as these 2 million square feet of new office space reenter the market but others believe it can be absorbed without much difficulty
5043,5042,1-28-1987,New York,Financial Developments,midsized banks in the second district report that lending activity increased dramatically in late 1986 the surveyed banks attributed the increase primarily to changes in the tax code which encouraged transactions to be completed by year end the changes include the future elimination of investment tax credits a higher capital gains tax rate and less favorable treatment of depreciation expenses all of the banks surveyed stated that last minute merger and acquisition activity was not a factor in the loan surge in general real estate loans which had been strong throughout the year increased the most the banks added that they expect demand for both real estate loans and small business loans to increase further during early 1987
5111,5110,3-16-1987,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the second districts economy showed some gains since the last report january retail sales were mixed but a decided improvement was noted in february while residential construction was seasonally slack a pickup in office leasing was noted in several areas some improvement also occurred in district business activity most small and midsized banks report a noticeable slowdown in ira deposits for this time of year
5112,5111,3-16-1987,New York,Consumer Spending,the pattern of sales at district department stores was mixed during january as consumer spending ranged from somewhat below to considerably above retailers expectations however a decided improvement was noted in february by those stores reporting early results and one respondent characterized the month as unbelievably goodforeign visitors utilizing their stronger currencies are still mentioned as one factor bolstering district spending another factor is the health of its economy relative to areas with oil and farm debt problems items for which there was good demand during january were most types of apparel jewelry and accessories februarys sales gains resulted from consumer buying across a wide spectrum of merchandise as a result of both the recent strength in sales and a conscious effort to monitor stocks retailers report inventories ranging from well below desired levels to on plan
5113,5112,3-16-1987,New York,Business Activity,some improvement occurred in the districts economic expansion in recent weeks more than onethird of the purchasing managers in the buffalo and rochester surveys reported that general business conditions were better in january up from 25 percent in decemberoverall employment has grown in the district though the manufacturing sector continues to decline the february unemployment rates of 41 percent in new jersey and 49 percent in new york were the lowest since the early 70s and are well below the national average moreover the overtheyear reduction in the new york and new jersey rates was three times the national declinerecent announcements point to a mixed impact on the districts economy on the one hand gms decision to produce its new minivans in westchester county will secure several thousand jobs there for a number of years on the other hand several other longestablished firms plan to curtail or phase out operations with a resultant loss of many jobs in addition while central new york will gain hundreds of jobs as the result of a recent merger buffalo and northern new jersey will lose at least the same number due to that same consolidation
5114,5113,3-16-1987,New York,Construction and Real Estate,residential construction has been seasonally slack but homebuilders in most areas continue to anticipate considerable demand for new homes in 1987 plans for several new types of housing development have been announced in recent weeks in downtown stamford connecticut where until now only new office building has been undertaken construction of the first highrise condominium is to begin this summer in newark new jersey the mayor recently signed a contract for the construction of 650 moderatelypriced townhouses the largest addition to that citys housing stock in decades finally in new york city several programs are planned or underway to provide new middle and low income housing since a shortage of affordable housing is increasingly being mentioned as a deterrent to further economic growth in the new york metropolitan area these new undertakings should help in this regarda pickup in office leasing activity was noted in several parts of the district during recent weeks and with the continued slowdown in new construction projects lower vacancy rates are anticipated in a number of areas westchester for example reports strong demand for both large and small blocks of space in its new buildings while in manhattan some observers expect the office vacancy rate to decline to 9 or 10 percent in 1987 from its 10 to 13 percent range last year elsewhere in the district industrial space is reported in short supply in northern new jersey particularly in areas near new york city or major highways and prices of land and buildings have risen sharply upstate new york expects 1987 to be a busy year for nonresidential construction as the result of congressional appropriations for extensive expansion and renovation of three military bases in the area
5115,5114,3-16-1987,New York,Financial Developments,most small and midsized banks in the second district report that there has been a noticeable slowdown in ira deposits from the usual inflow at this time of year most of the banks surveyed indicated that the decline stems from confusion concerning the impact of the new tax law and the low interest earned on ira deposits many bank customers are unaware that there is still time to make an ira deposit and claim a deduction for the 1986 tax year in addition others have reservations about making the investment because of concerns about the future impact of the tax law on money already placed in iras one of the banks indicated that some of its own officers were not well informed about the implications of the tax reform and were reluctant to suggest iras as an investment most banks added that these problems have been compounded by the current low interest rates available on ira deposits and restrictions concerning withdrawal of these funds all of the banks indicated that uncertainty concerning the tax law and the low level of interest rates would have an even more striking impact on the surge of activity which usually occurs as the april 15 deadline nears
5177,5176,5-4-1987,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,in general the second district economy registered a modest improvement since the last report retailers had betterthan expected sales gains during march and the homebuilding season has gotten underway with a good start office leasing was reported to be good and general business conditions were described as stable to improved on the financial side small and midsized banks report that growth in consumer lending has been weak since the beginning of the year
5178,5177,5-4-1987,New York,Consumer Spending,march sales at second district department stores were reported as good despite the fact that easter did not occur until midapril this year overtheyear gains ranged from 6 to 9 percent and were generally above plan since march 1986 had included the easter holiday because of the shifting of easter between march and april many retailers look at the twomonth period as one combined selling season demand was favorable for goods such as furniture home furnishings and housewares though sale of apparel and accessories were relatively weak in march and stores specializing in these did not fare as well interest in apparel and accessories items traditionally associated with easter shopping picked up substantially as the holiday grew near and district respondents anticipate a good showing for the month of april as wellwith march sales ranging 1 to 3 percent above goals that were described as aggressive inventories have generally been maintained at or below desired levels one chain with higherthanintended stocks indicated that paring its inventories is a major objective in the weeks immediately ahead
5179,5178,5-4-1987,New York,Business Activity,the improved tone in the districts economy continued in recent weeks eighty percent or more of the rochester and buffalo purchasing managers reporting in the march surveys described general business conditions as stable or better than in february and a modest buildup in inventories was not viewed as unfavorableunemployment rates edged lower in both new york and new jersey during march to 47 percent and 37 percent respectively as nonmanufacturing employment expanded further unemployment rates remained at their lowest levels in 17 yearswith the termination of the air force training plane contract with fairchild republic in march the longfeared closing of that companys long island plant is now underway some 1800 of its 3500 employees have already been dismissed and the plant is scheduled to close by yearend a group of former employees is attempting to purchase the facility and resume aircraft production but the success of this plan is seen as unlikely more positive news in recent weeks was eastman kodaks announcement that it will build a new 200 million color film plant at its manufacturing complex in rochester consolidating technology it has been developing around the world
5180,5179,5-4-1987,New York,Construction and Real Estate,as the homebuilding season gets underway district contacts report that the market continues to look very good and demand for new housing remains strong the recent sharp increase in mortgage rates has apparently had little dampening impact as the level of rates remains relatively low however shortages of available and affordable land are increasingly cited as major problems and possible deterrents to much additional homebuilding in some areas for 1987 though builders are expected to be quite busy and the level of activity to equal or be minimally below the 1986 paceoffice leasing activity in the second district has been good recently but not substantial enough to reduce vacancy rates in areas of oversupply rates in northern new jersey and fairfield and westchester counties eg remain in the 20 to 25 percent range and projects already in the pipeline continue under construction with an overall official vacancy rate of about 8 percent new york city is still one of the healthiest markets in the country while it is generally expected that midtown will show some improvement in 1987 opinion is divided about the vacancy rate in lower manhattan where about 7 million square feet of new office space is scheduled to come on line
5181,5180,5-4-1987,New York,Financial Developments,small and midsized banks in the second district report that growth in consumer lending has been weak since the beginning of 1987 most banks indicated that originations of consumer installment 1oans primary mortgages and agricultural loans have slowed while demand for other types of loans such as automobile loans remains almost negligible high consumer indebtedness housing shortages problems in the farm and dairy businesses and competition from auto finance companies were cited as reasons for the weakness some bank officers reported that their applications for mortgage loans had picked up recently as other banks announced increased lending rates and consumers rushed to borrow prior to further rate increases however the banks which experienced the surge of activity are now raising their own mortgage rates or plan to do so in the near future therefore the demand for such loans is expected to drop off at these banks and in the aggregate to fall below the usual level for this time of year lending officers believe that increases in home equity and unsecured personal loans will not be enough to compensate for the weakness in other forms of consumer lending
5245,5244,6-23-1987,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,the modest uptrend in the second district economy continued in recent weeks most retailers had sales gains that were at or above plan and residential construction remained strong business activity showed some improvement and demand for office space was generally good small and midsized banks report that consumer loans continue weak however despite increasing attempts to attract borrowers
5246,5245,6-23-1987,New York,Consumer Spending,second district department store sales were relatively strong in recent weeks according to our contacts due to the late easter this year sizable overtheyear gains during april had been anticipated however the 13 to 16 percent increases actually posted were generally larger than had been targeted may sales gains of 7 to 9 percent were for the most part in line with expectations the major exception was a respondent whose may sales rise of 19 percent was even greater than his yearoveryear april increasein line with the easter holiday and spring season the items mentioned as most heavily in demand were adult apparel and various items for children most respondents reported that as a result of recent sales activity inventories remain on or close to plan however one retailer who noted a slowing of sales momentum in may described his inventories as a little heavier than desired
5247,5246,6-23-1987,New York,Business Activity,a pickup occurred recently in district economic activity both the buffalo and rochester surveys of purchasing managers registered an increase in those reporting improved business conditions in may and no respondents in rochester experienced a worsening in april both surveys had shown a decline in the percentage of firms with better conditions though the percentage with either stable or better conditions was essentially unchanged the may reports also showed a sharp drop in firms encountering higher commodity pricesdistrict unemployment rates of 42 percent in new jersey and 48 percent in new york remain well below the united states average however some recent developments have elicited considerable concern about the districts employment outlook a labor department study just released shows that from 1984 to 1987 manufacturing jobs declined much more rapidly here than nationwide in addition two major corporations announced plans to move their corporate headquarters and 6000 employees from the region over the next year or so much public discussion has ensued about what is needed to avoid the exodus of other major corporations as well as about the increased vulnerability of the districts economy due to its narrowing industry mix
5248,5247,6-23-1987,New York,Construction and Real Estate,residential construction activity is strong in the second district and builders continue to anticipate that this year will see a high level of homebuilding while some areas expect a slowing from last years hectic pace other newly developing areas look for an even higher rate of activity the rise in mortgage rates has apparently not yet had much of a dampening effect and in fact may be prompting some additional demand in additional of further rate increases however a cautious note has been injected into the outlook in northern new jersey where a shortage of affordable land has been an increasing problem an 18month moratorium has just been declared on building in the new jersey wetlands and its impact on residential development is uncertainoffice leasing activity in the second district has continued at a good pace with reports of brisk demand in the midtown manhattan market although the recently announced plans of mobil and jc penney to move their corporate headquarters from manhattan mean the release of an additional three million square feet the consensus seems to be that this can be accommodated with no real difficulty a major new project getting underway is a 900 million complex of offices condominiums and stores in jersey city while the overall vacancy rate in northern new jersey remains high this project on the hudson river is reportedly at a prime location because of its proximity to public transportation as well as new york city
5249,5248,6-23-1987,New York,Financial Developments,small and midsized banks in the second district report that growth in consumer loans has remained weak in recent months despite increasing attempts to attract borrowers banks indicated that originations of personal automobile and mortgage loans have all been considerably lower than their usual level for this time of year respondents attributed the decline to the attractiveness of other products such as home equity credit lines high consumer indebtedness and competition from the auto finance companies several banks emphasized the importance of home equity credit and suggested its growth relative to more traditional consumer loans has been exerting pressure to lower rates in the problematic areas banks cited the desire for a more balanced portfolio between fixed rate consumer and variable rate home equity loans as well as the higher profit margins on the fixed rate category as reasons underlying this pressure most surveyed banks indicated that they have begun to offer lower rates on several types of consumer credit or plan to do so in the near future in addition most of the banks are in the process of increasing advertising and marketing efforts to current and prospective bank customers
5312,5311,8-3-1987,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,developments in the second district economy varied somewhat among sectors during recent weeks general business conditions continued to be stable or improved and office leasing remained good in most areas some slowing in residential construction activity occurred however and consumer spending was not uniformly on or above plan small and midsized banks reported a decline in primary mortgage rates during june and july
5313,5312,8-3-1987,New York,Consumer Spending,the pattern of sales at district department stores was mixed during june but for the most part respondents reported results that were on or above plan one retailer with lowerthantargeted june sales noted that its stores ran a special promotional in may with very strong sales and this detracted from some of their usual fathers day business in june consequently the chain is viewing the two months as a single unit this year the combined results for which were slightly above plan overall june sales among respondents ranged from 4 percent to 12 percent above yearearlier levelsitems for which there was good demand in june were apparel of all types not just for fathers day and housewares furniture and rugs inventories continue to be monitored closely and generally are on or slightly above target one retailer whose chain has had higherthandesired stocks in recent months plans an additional promotional in the near future to try to pare inventories
5314,5313,8-3-1987,New York,Business Activity,the improved tone in the districts economic activity continued in recent weeks the buffalo survey of purchasing managers registered a sizable increase in the percentage reporting better conditions while in rochester for the second consecutive month no respondents experienced a worsening both area surveys however found an increase during june in the percentage of firms reporting higher commodity costs following a decline in mayseveral recent developments point to a positive impact on the districts economy the new york times announced plans to spend 400 million its largest capital investment ever on a new printing plant in new jersey estimated to be the size of 20 football fields the plant will ease production constraints at existing sites and permit growth of the sunday edition also in new jersey governor kean has just presented plans for a 200 million state center for the performing arts to be erected in newark plus expenditures of about 50 million on other performance facilities in the district in another development ground was recently broken in manhattan for shearson lehmans new office tower which upon completion will house 1500 new employees together with 5000 workers currently employed by the firm
5315,5314,8-3-1987,New York,Construction and Real Estate,a slackening in the pace of district residential construction occurred in recent weeks which was described in terms ranging from negligible to definitely slower the main reasons cited for the slowdown were a two percentage point rise in mortgage rates in some areas and the high level to which land and home prices have risen in others responses were also mixed as to the nearterm outlook some homebuilders reported a pickup had already begun while others anticipated that the slower pace would continue for the most part however district builders still expect this years activity to run at or close to the rate in 1986 which for many was a recordleasing activity in the districts commercial and industrial markets generally remains good among new undertakings construction has begun on a large mixeduse office residential and commercial complex at a fouracre site in midmanhattan which for many years had served as a parking lot a major tenant has already been announced for the office skyscraper to be built there while conditions have generally been good some concern has been voiced recently regarding developments in westchester county and northern new jersey where office vacancy rates remain at 20 or above leasing activity in much of westchester has been slow in recent months and while northern new jersey continues to attract new tenants a spate of newly announced large office projects has raised the possibility of increasing vacancy rates
5316,5315,8-3-1987,New York,Financial Developments,small and midsized banks in the second district report that primary mortgage rates have mirrored the national pattern rising during april and may and declining by a smaller amount since then the banks attributed the recent decline to consumer resistance to higher rates and competitive pressures from other banks most banks expected that the reduced demand for primary mortgages would put additional downward pressure on rates in the near future however a few respondents thought that rates had stabilized as interest rates rose earlier in the year the demand for adjustable rate mortgages relative to fixed rate loans increased dramatically this trend has reversed itself since interest rates turned down and the portfolio mix now is very close to that at the beginning of the year despite the lower demand for primary mortgages banks do not expect that home equity loans will be negatively affected because of the low rates and tax advantages associated with them
5381,5380,9-8-1987,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,economic activity in the second district continued to vary among sectors in recent weeks general business conditions improved somewhat further and office leasing was fairly good homebuilding activity displayed a mixed pattern however and july spending at some retailers was below plan on the financial side small and mid sized banks expect only a mild increase in inflation over the near term

5383,5382,9-8-1987,New York,Business Activity,general business conditions in the second district improved somewhat further in recent weeks the percentage of buffalo purchasing agents reporting improved or stable conditions rose in july while in rochester for the third consecutive month there were no reports of worsened business conditions inventories were down somewhat but remain at comfortable levelunemployment rates moved lower in both new york and new jersey during july to 44 percent and 40 percent respectively rates in most of the districts labor market areas are below the national average and in several instances have declined sharply since last year in elmira for example where some new plants have opened the unemployment rate dropped from 61 percent to 36 percent over the year ended in june latest data while in buffalo the rate fell from 69 percent to 50 percent over the same period as 20000 new jobs were added the rebuilding of the fort drum military post now underway in northern new york state is providing a stimulus to syracuse and several depressed economies in the upstate area
5384,5383,9-8-1987,New York,Construction and Real Estate,district residential construction activity presented a mixed pattern in recent weeks in the downstate and new jersey markets some further slowing has occurred and homebuilders report little traffic by prospective buyers in their areas most pentup demand has already been satisfied and high land and home prices tend to be deterrents upstate however builders remain quite busy completing existing contracts and some areas report strong interest in future contracts home prices in these areas have either held steady or risen only moderately overall starts in the district in 1987 are now expected to be down somewhat from last years leveloffice leasing activity has been fairly good in much of the district and in new york city where the vacancy rate is already relatively low a pickup has recently occurred in commitments for space in some new buildings however vacancy rates remain at 20 percent or above in areas such as westchester and fairfield counties and northern new jersey while office construction has virtually halted in westchester new buildings continue to come on line in fairfield and new jersey
5385,5384,9-8-1987,New York,Financial Developments,senior officers at small and midsized banks in the second district reported expectations of only a mild increase in inflation in the near future rising oil prices due to political unrest in the middle east and the falling dollar were the factors most commonly cited as likely to lead to an acceleration of the inflation rate expectations of higher inflation were tempered however by a widespread belief that chairman greenspan would pursue a strong antiinflationary monetary policy reflecting their anticipation of a modest increase in inflation the officers believe that interest rates will show only a slight rise if any by the end of the year most of these bankers expressed hesitancy to raise their interest rates any higher this year unless the money center banks initiate such a move
5448,5447,10-27-1987,New York,Summary of Economic Activity,in general the second district economy registered some improvement since the last report the latest purchasing managers surveys showed a sizable increase in firms reporting better business conditions and retailers experienced satisfactory sales in recent weeks office leasing activity was also good but the residential construction market remains mixed on the financial side most small and midsized banks have raised their lending rates in response to prime rate increases at money center banks

5450,5449,10-27-1987,New York,Business Activity,the improved tone in the districts economy continued in recent weeks the latest purchasing managers surveys from buffalo and rochester showed a sizable increase an the percentage of firms reporting an improvement in general business conditions inventories were also somewhat higher but the level was not burdensomeplans were announced for several major new projects in the district these include a proposal for a new residential community of some 1200 condominiums on a waterfront site in new jersey where an auto assembly plant was formerly located and a project in brooklyn to build 2500 middleincome apartments along the waterfront together with a public park promenade and space for light industrial use on long island work is scheduled to begin in november on a 362 room hotel resort and conference center the first phase of a 150 million mixeduse development which will also include town houses and an office building in addition the lifting of a 7month building ban elsewhere on long island is expected to result in the construction of several residential and commercial projects that have been on holdunemployment rates in the district showed little change in september when both new york and new jersey posted rates of 45 new york citys unemployment rate also fell to 45 its lowest level in 17 years while unemployment rates have dropped substantially throughout the district in recent years analysts in some labor markets such as buffalo view the decline with caution they attribute much of the improvement to substantial outmigration and the substitution of lowpaying service jobs for the highpaying manufacturing positions which once were prevalent

5719,5718,5-4-1988,New York,Residential Construction and Real Estate,activity in the districts residential construction market has been somewhat sluggish due in part to the unusually cold weather this spring season homebuilders report some recent improvement and anticipate much more traffic and interest in the months ahead however few expect the 1988 pace to match that in recent years less pentup demand a growing shortage of suitable land in some areas and the high level at which home prices seem to have stabilized are cited as factors which are expected to contribute to some slowing this yearthe pace of office leasing generally has improved within the district demand for office space in midtown manhattan picked up substantially in recent weeks but downtown manhattan leasing remains slow elsewhere in the metropolitan area demand is reported strong some fairfield county spokesmen state that a real upturn is occurring the relatively few new office projects currently planned there and in westchester county are generating some optimism that the high vacancy rates may soon decline hotel construction is one category in which considerable building is either planned or underwaymost noticeably in manhattan where four hotels are currently being built and four more are scheduled higher rentals relatively high occupancy rates and a record number of visitors are spurring this development

6263,6262,5-3-1989,New York,Business Activity,unemployment rates in new york and new jersey fell by almost one percentage point in march as new jerseys rate hit a record low the improvement was primarily the result of fewer persons seeking work rather than a marked increase in employment and may not be sustainable in the months ahead on long island for example the local economy is braced for the continuing impact of the navys cancellation last december of an attack bomber contract a loss of several thousand more jobs is expected at the aircraft company and its suppliers by yearend in addition the recent announcement by a major new york city securities firm that it plans a substantial restructuring which could result in the layoff of a couple of thousand employees is also a source of concern the brokerage industry is still feeling the effects of the october 1987 stock market crash and a slowdown in retail activity since that timeeightyfour percent of purchasing managers in rochester and 75 percent in buffalo reported stable to improved general business conditions in march virtually unchanged from the february numbers in both cities more than half the surveyed firms reported higher prices on the commodities they purchasedfew new investment projects were announced in recent weeks among the largest of these was a 70 million business park in the rochester area which eastman kodak and pioneer development corporation hope to begin constructing this year the park would include office buildings shops restaurants and hotels to be built on vacant land owned by kodak

6623,6622,12-6-1989,New York,Residential Construction and Real Estate,demand for new homes in the district remains mixed in some upstate new york areas where activity was already strong further recent gains are attributed to lower mortgage rates and more realistic pricing of homes for resale much of the new york metropolitan area continues to report little or no improvement in buyer interest however despite the general slack a few developers have undertaken projects they consider sufficiently attractive to elicit a favorable response for example a 24story condominium apartment house it going up on new york citys central park west where sites for new buildings are virtually nonexistent offering many highly sought after features of prewar structures and unobstructed views of the park and the citys skyline 21 of 38 units have been sold for september 1990 occupancy in the last three months although prices reportedly range from 900000 to 6 millionthe pace of office leasing has been good in much of the district but with the recent completion of substantial amounts of new space vacancy rates have generally held steady or edged higher moreover some new york city brokerage firms recently announced further staff reductions in their continuing costcutting efforts these moves could throw additional office space on the downtown manhattan market where vacancy rates have already risen due to earlier restructuring by financial firms even though no new buildings are currently planned there
6624,6623,12-6-1989,New York,Other Reports on Business Activity,october surveys of purchasing managers in buffalo and rochester indicate some flattening out in general business conditions orders and production with an increased number of firms noting no change in these categories in addition in both surveys deteriorating conditions were reported by at least as many firms as reported an improvement substantially fewer purchasing managers reported higher input prices in october concerning the outlook the rochester survey showed a large increase in the percentage of respondents expecting a deterioration in business conditions over the next three monthsoctober unemployment rates of 47 percent and 51 percent in new york and new jersey respectively were again below the national average however october was the first month in three years that new jerseys rate was above 5 percent and the unemployment outlook for the district is uncertain in the wake of relatively weak investor volume and a slowdown in new issues and merger and acquisition activity several brokerage firms recently announced plans for additional cutbacks totaling some 1200 employees some observers expect this number to climb even higher as more restructuring occurs in the securities industry further layoffs are also occurring at some auto parts manufacturers as a result of sluggish demand for cars on the other hand while demand for autos is slow interest in new minivans is reportedly strong enough to be boosting employment at minivan parts and assembly plants in the district moreover the house of representatives voted for the production of 18 more f14 fighter planes which could maintain employment levels on long island
6625,6624,12-6-1989,New York,Financial Developments,most senior officers surveyed at small and midsized banks in the second district report that demand for home mortgages has declined somewhat over the past year the reported depth of the decline varied considerably however ranging from virtually no change to decidedly lower all respondents stated that their mortgage activity is heavily concentrated in either fixed or adjustable rate loans a few banks offer only one or the other type of financing a majority of the banks reported greater demand for fixed rather than adjustable rate mortgages which may be due to declines on average in fixed rates while adjustable rates have increased responses were mixed regarding the current strength of the bankers local residential real estate market one officer noted that while overall demand was slow certain pockets in highly desirable areas were still doing well several respondents cited a seasonal slowdown and recessionary fears as causes of the current downturn most bankers stated that they are aggressively marketing mortgages at the present time but only onequarter are currently offering concessionary firstyear rates on adjustable rate mortgages despite a slight increase in national delinquency rates fewer than half of the respondents expressed any concern about delinquencies

6686,6685,1-24-1990,New York,Construction and Real Estate,homebuilding activity is seasonally slow throughout the district but the underlying demand for new homes remains mixed a glut of homes for resale continues to plague much of the new york metropolitan area whereas some upstate new york communities report that buyer interest in their areas is still strong home prices have declined somewhat in the new york metropolitan area due largely to reductions by hardpressed sellers regarding the outlook homebuilders in the downstate area are not optimistic anticipating that despite lower mortgage rates 1990 will be another tough yearwhile office leasing activity in manhattan was reported brisk in recent weeks substantial amounts of additional space were placed on the market by consolidating and restructuring firms as a result vacancy rates for primary space in both midtown and downtown manhattan rose and some observers anticipate further increases as buildings now under construction are completed office vacancy rates remain high in some of the districts suburban areas but for the most part have stabilized or declined recently due to a slowdown in new construction

6688,6687,1-24-1990,New York,Financial Developments,most officers of small to mediumsized banks in the second district reported an overtheyear decline in demand for many types of bank credit frequently citing sluggish local economies as the cause commercial and industrial loan demand declined at all but one reporting bank bankers indicated that caution in the business community and anticipation of interest rate declines may be forestalling demand the single officer who noted an increase in strength said his community is home to large noncyclical firms which are currently expanding most respondents reported that consumer loan demand has also fallen off a few officers ascribed the decline to consumer uncertainty about interest rates and the future of the economy however most believed that as a result of incentives created by tax reform consumer borrowing has been largely redirected into home equity financing while all other loan demand has declined nearly half of the officers reported increased demand for home equity loans most respondents said that mortgage lending has also declined several bankers indicated that in recent years real estate prices have been somewhat overvalued and that potential buyers are waiting for the market to complete its natural correction two officers noted that mortgage demand in their communities is quite strong crediting the growth to businesses relocating into their vicinities because other areas were too expensive despite the fact that overall loan demand has been soft recently bankers foresee slow to moderate loan growth in the coming year

6818,6817,5-2-1990,New York,Financial Developments,based on a survey of senior officers at small and mediumsized banks in the second district demand for commercial loans is weaker than a year ago most bankers agreed that the general decline in interest rates over the last year failed to stimulate much loan activity and cited the weak economy and cautious investing as the main factors for falling demand one banker noted that any interestrateinduced increase would have teen offset by the current economic climate when asked if any particular sectors showed unusually strong or weak demand twothirds of the bankers cited a weakness in real estate and manufacturing loans while a couple noted strength among retailers almost all respondents described their local economies as stable or weak signs of weakness cited were higher vacancy rates more delinquent loans contracting real estate markets and layoffs the two bankers who characterized their economies as strong also described them as diversified when asked about expectations of future loan demand the majority of the bankers forecasted stable or lower demand the bankers anticipate weak real estate markets and cautious attitudes by both investors and lenders for the remainder of 1990
